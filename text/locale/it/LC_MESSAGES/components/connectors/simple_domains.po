"You may have seen a similar table before with slightly different choices.  "
"For example, you will sometimes see velocity (in :math:`m/s`) chosen as the "
"across variable for translational motion. The choices above are guided by "
"two constraints."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/connectors/simple_domains.rst:29
msgid ""
"The first constraint is that the through variable should be the time "
"derivative of some conserved quantity.  The reason for this constraint is "
"that the through variable will be used to formulate generalized conservation"
" equations in our system.  As such, it is essential that the through "
"variables be conserved quantities."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/connectors/simple_domains.rst:35
msgid ""
"The second constraint is that the across variable should be the lowest order"
" derivative to appear in any of our constitutive or empirical equations in "
"the domain.  So, for example, we chose position for translational motion "
"because position is used in describing the behavior of a spring (*i.e.,* "
"Hooke's law).  If we had chosen velocity (the derivative of position with "
"respect to time), then we would have been in the awkward situation of trying"
" to describe the behavior of a spring in terms of velocities, not positions."
"  An essential point here is that **differentiation is lossy**.  If we know "
"position, we can easily express velocity.  But if we only know velocity, we "
"cannot compute position without knowing an additional integration constant. "
"This is why we want to work with across variables that have not been overly "
"differentiated."
