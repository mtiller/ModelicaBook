"Several of the examples in this chapter used arrays of components. Arrays of"
" components are useful when the user might want to \"scale\" the number of "
"components used using a parameter (as we saw in our discussions of both :ref"
":`distributed-heat-transfer` and :ref:`harmonic-motion`)."

"the syntax for creating an array of components is identical to the syntax "
"used for other types.  All that is required is to follow the name of the "
"variable being declared by a set of dimensions."

"However, unlike scalars, components have other declarations inside them.  So"
" whenever an array of components is created, the structure of that component"
" is replicated for each component in the array. Modelica imposes a "
"restriction that in every array, every element must be the same type.  This "
"may seem obvious, but that is partly because we haven't discussed "
"``replaceable`` components yet.  We'll learn more about ``replaceable`` "
"components in the next chapter when we talk about Modelica's :ref"
":`configuration-management` features.  But for now we will simply point out "
"that it is not possible to ``redeclare`` only one element in an array."

"As we touched on briefly in our discussion of :ref:`harmonic-motion`, when "
"we make :ref:`sub-modifications` to arrays of components, each variable "
"inside the component is implicitly treated as an array.  For example, "
"consider the following ``record`` definition:"

"If we were to declare an array of ``Point`` components, *e.g.,* ``Point "
"p[5]``, any reference to ``p.x`` is treated as an array of 5 ``Real`` "
"variables, *i.e.,* ``p[1].x``, ``p[2].x``, ``p[3].x``, ``p[4].x`` and "
"``p[5].x``.  This is called *slicing*.  The bottom line is that if we leave "
"off a subscript (*e.g.,* ``p.x``), it gets \"pushed to the end\" (or more "
"technically, it is left \"unbound\" and can be \"bound\" later).  Also, if a"
" subscript is supplied as a range (*e.g.,* ``:``, ``1:end``, ``2:3``), then "
"the expression resolves to a subset of the array corresponding to the "
"indices in the range.  All of this holds even for arrays of components "
"containing arrays of components and so on."
