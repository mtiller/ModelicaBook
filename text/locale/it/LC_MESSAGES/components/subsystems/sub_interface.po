"The emphasis of this chapter was on how component models could be organized "
"into reusable subsystems.  As we saw in numerous examples in this chapter, "
"there is a common pattern that emerges.  Let's review various aspects of "
"subsystem models to understand this pattern better."

"Generally, parameters for a subsystem should be ``public``.  Normally, all "
"declarations in any ``model`` or ``block`` definition will be public unless "
"they come after the ``protected`` keyword.  In such cases, it is still "
"possible to declare something as public by adding the ``public`` keyword and"
" placing the declarations after it.  In other words:"

"Obviously, parameters are made public so that users of the subsystem can "

"In some sense, connectors are what differentiates a subsystem from a system "
"model.  A system model is something that is complete and ready to simulate "
"and, as such, has no connectors because it does not expect to be influenced "
"by anything external.  A subsystem can encapsulate a large hierarchy of "
"components (and ultimately, equations).  But the fact that it includes "
"connectors indicates that it is really meant to be used as part of some "
"larger system.  Furthermore, as we have seen in the examples of this "
"chapter, because these connectors are meant to be connected to, they should "
"be ``public``."

"Because subsystems are typically composed exclusively of components or other"
" subsystems, any physical interaction with that subsystem is usually "
"redirected to some nested component or subsystem.  We've seen this pattern "
"many times in this chapter where connectors at the subsystem boundary really"
" act as \"proxies\" for internal connectors.  A simple example of this can "
"be seen in the ``GearWithBacklash`` model:"

"Note that this ``connect`` statement connects ``flange_a``, a connector "
"instance that belongs to the subsystem, with ``inertia_a.flange_a``, a "
"connector instance belonging to the subcomponent ``inertia_a``.  This is a "
"common pattern in subsystem models and it can be easily recognized because "
"one of the connectors named in the ``connect`` statement includes a "
"\"``.``\" and the other one does not.  All the \"internal\" connections that"
" wire together internal components directly to other internal components "
"will have a \"``.``\" for both of the named connectors in the ``connect`` "

"In this book, the point has been made repeatedly (*e.g.,* in our discussion "
"of :ref:`acausal-connections`) that the sign convention for ``flow`` "
"variables is such that a positive value for the ``flow`` variable represents"
" a flow into the component or subsystem.  At the same time, we also pointed "
"out that :ref:`system-connections` generate equations that sum all the "
"corresponding ``flow`` variables in the connection set to zero."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/subsystems/sub_interface.rst:100
msgid ""
"But, when dealing with hierarchical subsystem definitions there is a "
"modification to this rule.  For a subsystem, the sign convention for "
"``flow`` variables remains intact.  So, a positive value for the ``flow`` "
"variable on a connector still represents a flow of a conserved quantity into"
" that component.  And it is still the case that a conservation equation will"
" be generated for each ``flow`` variable in a connection set.  However, in "
"that conservation equation, the sign for ``flow`` variables on connectors "
"belonging to internal components will have the opposite sign as ``flow`` "
"variables on connectors belonging to the subsystem itself."

"Normally, these implementation details are best hidden from the end user of "
"the subsystem.  To accomplish this, all non-``parameter`` declarations in a "
"subsystem are typically marked as ``protected``. There are two main reasons "
"for doing this.  First, it hides implementation details from the users of "
"the subsystem model.  This has the effect of simplifying the interface down "
"to just parameters and connectors and avoids mixing things the user really "
"needs to know with things that they do not need to know (or even should not "
"know). Another reason to make the implementation details ``protected`` is to"
" provide the flexibility to improve or refactor the implementation in the "
"future.  If users are allowed to reference the implementation details, that "
"means they will then (perhaps even unintentionally) become **dependent** on "
"them.  As a result, if they change in the future it will break the end "
"user's models."
