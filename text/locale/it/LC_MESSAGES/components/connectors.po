"Before diving into some examples, there is a bit of background required in "

"So far, we've talked primarily about how to model behavior.  What we've seen"
" so far are models composed largely of textual equations.  But from this "
"point forward, we will be exploring how to create reusable component models."
"  So instead of writing Ohm's law whenever we wish to model a resistor, "
"we'll instead add an instance of a **resistor** component model to our "
"system."

"Until now, the models that we've shown have all been self contained. All the"
" behavior of our entire system was captured in a single model and "
"represented by textual equations.  But this approach does not scale well.  "
"What we really want is the ability to create reusable component models."

"But before we can dive into how to create these components, we need to first"
" discuss how we will be connecting them together.  The component models that"
" we will be building during the remainder of the book are still represented "
"by a ``model`` definition.  What sets them apart from the models we have "
"seen so far is that they will feature **connectors**."

"A ``connector`` is a way for one model to exchange information with another "
"model.  As we'll see, there are different ways that we may wish to exchange "
"this information and this chapter will focus on explaining the various "
"semantics that can be used to describe connectors in Modelica."

"In order to understand one specific class of connector semantics, it is "
"first necessary to understand a bit more about acausal formulations of "
"physical systems.  An acausal approach to physical modeling identifies two "
"distinct classes of variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/connectors.rst:55
msgid ""
"The first class of variables we will discuss are \"across\" variables (also "
"called *potential* or *effort* variables).  Differences in the values of "
"across variables across a component are what trigger components to react.  "
"Typical examples of across variables, that we will be discussing shortly, "
"are temperature, voltage and pressure. Differences in these quantities "
"typically lead to dynamic behavior in the system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/connectors.rst:63
msgid ""
"The second class of variables we will discuss are \"through\" variables "
"(also called *flow* variables).  Flow variables normally represent the flow "
"of some conserved quantity like mass, momentum, energy, charge, *etc.*  "
"These flows are usually the result of some difference in the across "
"variables across a component model.  For example, current flowing through a "
"resistor is in response to a voltage difference across the two sides of the "
"resistor.  As we will see in many of the examples to come, there are many "
"different types of relationships between the through and across variables "
"(Ohm's law being just one of many)."

"It is extremely important to know that Modelica follows a convention that a "
"positive value for a through variable represents flow of the conserved "
"quantity **into** a component.  We'll repeat this convention several times "
"later in the book (especially once we begin our discussion of how to build "
"models of :ref:`components`)."
