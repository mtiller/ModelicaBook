"If, for some reason, you are coming upon this book without any previous "
"knowledge of Modelica, there are probably a couple of questions you have.  "
"Let me attempt to address these questions in the hope that they will "
"intrigue you and cause you to dig deeper."

"Modelica is a high-level declarative language for describing mathematical "
"behavior.  It is typically applied to engineering systems and can be used to"
" easily describe the behavior of different types of engineering components "
"(*e.g.,* springs, resistors, clutches, *etc.*).  These components can then "
"be combined into subsystems, systems or even architectures."

msgid "Why Modelica?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/front/intro.rst:22
msgid ""
"Modelica is compelling for several reasons.  First and foremost, it is "
"technically very capable.  By using complex algorithms behind the scenes, "
"Modelica compilers allow engineers to focus on high-level mathematical "
"descriptions of component behavior and get high performance simulation "
"capability in return without having to be deeply knowledgeable about complex"
" topics like differential-algebraic equations, symbolic manipulation, "
"numeric solvers, code generation, post-processing, *etc.*."

msgid ""
"The key to Modelica's technical success is its support for a wide range of "
"modeling formalisms that allow the description of both continuous and "
"discrete behavior framed in the context of hybrid differential-algebraic "
"equations.  The language supports both causal (often used for control system"
" design) and acausal (often used in creating schematic oriented physical "
"designs) approaches *within the same model*."

"Finally, another compelling aspect of Modelica is the fact that it was "
"designed from the start as an open language.  The specification is freely "
"available and tool vendors are encouraged to support the import and export "
"of Modelica (without being compelled to pay any royalty of any kind)."

"Modelica is really an ideal language for modeling the behavior of "
"engineering systems in nearly any engineering domain.  It seamlessly "
"supports both physical design and control design in a single language. It is"
" also multi-domain so it doesn't impose any artificial boundaries that "
"restrict its use to select engineering domains or systems.  The result is "
"that it provides a complete set of capabilities for building lumped system "
"models of nearly any engineering system."
