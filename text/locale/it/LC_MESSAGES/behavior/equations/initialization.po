"As we already touched on during our previous discussion on :ref:`steady-"
"state`, behavior is represented by both the equations contained in a model "
"as well as the initial conditions given to the state variables in the model."
"  In Modelica, the initial conditions are computed by combining the normal "
"equations (present in `equation` sections) with any initial equations "
"(present in `initial equation` sections)."

"One of the first sources of confusion for new users is understanding how "
"many initial conditions are required.  The answer to this question is "
"simple.  In order to have a well-posed initialization problem (one where we "
"don't have too many or too few initial equations), we need to have the same "
"number of equations in the `initial equation` sections as we have states in "
"our system.  **Note**, we can get away with having too few, because tools "
"can augment the initial equations we provide with additional ones until the "
"problem is well-posed, but we cannot solve a problem where we have too many "
"initial equations."

"Of course, saying the number of initial equations has to be equal to the "
"number of states answers one question, but quickly creates another, *i.e.,* "
"*how do we determine how many states there are*?  For the models we've seen "
"in this chapter, the answer is quite simple.  The states in each of our "
"examples so far are the variables that appear inside the ``der(...)`` "
"operator.  In other words, every variable that we differentiated in those "
"examples is a state."

"It is important to note that **it will not always be the case** that every "
"variable that we differentiate will be a state.  In this chapter, all the "
"models we have seen so far are ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  When"
" dealing with ODEs, every differentiated variable is a state, which, in "
"turn, means that you need an initial equation for each of these "
"differentiated variables.  But in subsequent chapters we will eventually run"
" across examples that are so-called differential-algebraic equations (DAEs)."
"  In those cases, only *some* of the differentiated variables can be "
"considered states."

"As it turns out, understanding initialization doesn't really require us to "
"get into a detailed discussion about DAEs.  In practice, all Modelica tools "
"perform something called \"index reduction\".  While the index reduction "
"algorithms themselves are fairly complicated (so we won't get into those "
"now), the effect is quite simple.  Index reduction transforms the DAEs into "
"ODEs.  In other words, Modelica compilers will transform whatever DAE "
"problem contained in our Modelica code into this relatively easy to explain "
"ODE form."

"So let's side-step the discussion about DAEs and index reduction and just "
"pick up our discussion of initialization assuming our problem has already "
"been reduced to an ODE.  In this case, the only thing we really need to "
"understand is that initialization is required for all states in the model "
"and that our model will have the following general ODE form:"

"Note that the arrow over a variable simply indicates that it is a vector, "

":math:`\\vec{x}` represents the states in the system.  One final thing to "

"This all works as long as there **was** a previous time step.  When there "

"  So we definitely need to be able to handle this case.  But this approach "
"won't work for the cases we showed in :ref:`steady-state`.  There we didn't "
"provide explicit initial values for states.  Instead, we provided initial "
"values for :math:`\\dot{\\vec{x}}(t_0)`.  So how can we capture both of "
