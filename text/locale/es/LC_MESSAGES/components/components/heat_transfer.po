"When building component models, the goal is to create component models that "

"Note that when ``port_a.T`` is greater than ``T_amb``, the sign of "

"In this context, a connection does two important things.  The first thing it"

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/components/heat_transfer.rst:227
msgid ""
"In addition, a connection generates an equation for all the through "
"variables as well.  The equation that is generated is a conservation "
"equation.  You can think of this conservation equation as a generalization "
"of Kirchoff's current law to any conserved quantity. Basically, it "
"represents the fact that the connection itself has no \"storage\" ability "
"and that whatever amount of the conserved quantity, in this case heat, that "
"flows out of one component must go into the other(s).  So in this case, the "
"connect statement will generate the following equation with respect to the "
"``flow`` variables:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/components/components/heat_transfer.rst:241
msgid ""
"Note the sign convention here.  All the ``flow`` variables are summed. We "
"will examine more complex cases shortly where multiple components are "
"interacting.  But in this simple case, with only two components, we see "
"clearly that if one value for ``Q_flow`` is positive, the other must be "
"negative.  In other words, if heat is flowing out of one component, it must "
"be flowing into another.  These conservation equations ensure that we have a"
" proper accounting of conserved quantities throughout our network and that "
"no amount of the conserved quantity gets \"lost\"."

"There is one slight issue with the ``CoolingToAmbient`` model.  We mentioned"
