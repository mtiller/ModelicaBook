"The ``initial equation`` demonstrates the significance that the value of the"

"The last thing worth noting about the model is the presence of the "

"To understand these equations it is first necessary to understand that any "
"model that ``extends`` from ``SinkOrSource`` will generally be connected to "
"a ``RegionalPopulation`` instance (but will not, itself, **be** a "
"``RegionalPopulation`` model).  This means that if the ``flow`` variable "
"``species.rate`` in such an instance is positive, it will have the effect of"
" pulling animals **out** of the ``RegionalPopulation`` model.  Looking at "
"the ``SinkOrSource`` model in this way, we can see that the variable "
"``decline`` is simply an alias for ``species.rate``.  In other words, when "
"``decline`` has a positive value, ``species.rate`` will have a positive "
"value and, therefore, any ``RegionalPopulation`` that this ``SinkOrSource`` "
"instance is connected to will suffer a drain on its population. Conversely, "
"the ``growth`` variable is positive when ``species.rate`` is negative.  In "
