"So far, the focus of this chapter has been on acausal modeling.  But "
"Modelica also supports causal formalisms.  The main reason for the emphasis "
"on acausal modeling is that it lends itself very well to the modeling of "
"physical systems.  It enables models of physical systems to be assembled "
"schematically rather than mathematically while also automatically "
"formulating conservation equations to ensure proper bookkeeping."

"Block diagrams are a different way of approach modeling.  The emphasis in "
"block diagram is on creating component models that represent a wide range of"
" mathematical operations.  The operations are then performed on (generally "
"time-varying) signals and yield, in turn, other signals.  In fact, we will "
"introduce a special kind of ``model`` in this section, called a ``block``, "
"that is restricted to having only ``input`` and ``output`` signals."

"In this section, we'll first look at how to construct causal blocks "
"representing some basic mathematical operations.  We'll then see how those "
"blocks can be used in two different ways.  The first way will be to model a "
"simple physical system.  We'll include some discussion contrasting the "
"causal and acausal approaches.  The second way to use such blocks is to "
"model control systems.  As we'll see, using blocks to construct control "
"systems is a much more natural fit for the block diagram formalism."

"Fortunately, Modelica allows both causal and acausal approaches and, as "
"we'll see shortly, even allows them to be mixed.  The result is that "
"Modelica allows the model developer to use whichever approach works best in "
