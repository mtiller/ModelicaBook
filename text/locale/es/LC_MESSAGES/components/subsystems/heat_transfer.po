"Our next example of creating reusable subsystems will introduce a slight "
"twist.  In this section we will not only demonstrate how to create a "
"reusable subsystem model, as in the previous examples from this chapter, but"
" that subsystem model will use an array of **component** instances where the"
" size of that array can be used to control the spatial resolution of the "
"results."

"This model consists of a collection of thermal capacitances with thermal "

"In our flat system model, we have 3 thermal capacitances and 5 conductances."
"  This configuration represents a rod that has been divided into 3 equal "
"segments and the conductance that occurs between those segments as well as "
"between each segment and some ambient conditions.  In theory, we can divide "
"a rod into :math:`N` equal segments with :math:`N-1` conduction paths "

"ambient conditions."

"Our particular configuration was for :math:`N=3`.  But we can create a "
"subsystem model where :math:`N` is a parameter of the subsystem.  In other "
"words, we can create a subsystem model that is divided into :math:`N` equal "
"segments.  But to do so, we cannot simply drag and drop the capacitances "
"into the model and connect them with conductances because we don't know the "
"exact number."
