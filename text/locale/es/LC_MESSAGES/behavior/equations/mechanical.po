"If you are more familiar with mechanical systems, this example might help "
"reinforce some of the concepts we've covered so far.  The system we wish to "
"model is the one shown in the following figure:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:16
msgid ""
"It is worth pointing out how much easier it is to convey the intention of a "
"model by presenting it in schematic form.  Assuming appropriate graphical "
"representations are used, experts can very quickly understand the "
"composition of the system and develop an intuition about how it is likely to"
" behave.  While we are currently focusing on equations and variables, we "
"will eventually work our way up to an approach (in the upcoming section of "
"the book on :ref:`components`) where **models will be built in this "
"schematic form from the beginning**."

"For now, however, we will focus on how to express the equations associated "
"with this simple mechanical system.  Each inertia has a rotational position,"
" :math:`\\varphi`, and a rotational speed, :math:`\\omega` where "
":math:`\\omega = \\dot{\\varphi}`.  For each inertia, the balance of angular"
" momentum for the inertia can be expressed as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:34
msgid ""
"In other words, the sum of the torques, :math:`\\tau`, applied to the "
"inertia should be equal to the product of the moment of inertia, :math:`J`, "
"and the angular acceleration, :math:`\\dot{\\omega}`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:40
msgid ""
"At this point, all we are missing are the torque values, :math:`\\tau_i`.  "
"From the previous figure, we can see that there are two springs and two "
"dampers.  For the springs, we can use Hooke's law to express the "
"relationship between torque and angular displacement as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:48
msgid ""
"For each damper, we express the relationship between torque and relative "
"angular velocity as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:53
msgid ""
"If we pull together all of these relations, we get the following system of "
"equations:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:63
msgid "Let's assume our system has the following initial conditions as well:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:73
msgid ""
"These initial conditions essentially mean that the system starts in a state "
"where neither inertia is actually moving (*i.e.*, :math:`\\omega=0`), but "
"there is a non-zero deflection across both springs."

"Pulling all of these variables and equations together, we can express this "
"problem in Modelica as follows:"

"Next, we introduce physical types for a rotational mechanical system, "

"Then we define the various parameters used to represent the different "
"physical characteristics of our system:"

"For this system, there are four non-``parameter`` variables.  These are "
"defined as follows:"

"The initial conditions (which we will revisit shortly) are then defined "

"The only drawback of this model is that all of our initial conditions have "
"been \"hard-coded\" into the model.  This means that we will be unable to "
"specify any alternative set of initial conditions for this model.  We can "
"overcome this issue, as we did with our :ref:`Newton cooling examples "
"<getting-physical>`, by defining ``parameter`` variables to represent the "
"initial conditions as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:146
msgid ""
"In this way, the parameter values can be changed either in the simulation "
"environment (where parameters are typically editable by the user) or, as we "
"will see shortly, via so-called \"modifications\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:150
msgid ""
"You will see in this latest version of the model that the values for the "
"newly introduced parameters are the same as the hard-coded values used "
"earlier.  As a result, the default initial conditions will be exactly the "
"same as they were before.  But now, we have the freedom to explore other "
"initial conditions as well.  For example, if we simulate the "
"``SecondOrderSystemInitParams`` model as is, we get the following solution "
"for the angular positions and velocities:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/mechanical.rst:161

"However, if modify the ``phi1_init`` parameter to be *1* at the start of our"
" simulation, we get this solution instead:"
