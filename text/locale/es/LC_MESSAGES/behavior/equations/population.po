"It is worth noting that this approach has both advantages and disadvantages."
"  The advantage is one of flexibility.  The ``start`` attribute is actually "

"There are a couple of disadvantages to the ``start`` attribute that you need"

"Note the cyclical behavior of each population.  Initially, there are more "

"experiences growth that is, for the moment, virtually unchecked by "

"The answer lies in the initial conditions.  Instead of specifying an initial"

"The answer lies in understanding that the functions :math:`x(t)` and "
