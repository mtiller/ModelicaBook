"In Modelica version 3.3, new features were introduced to address concerns "
"about non-deterministic discrete behavior [Elmqvist]_.  In this section, "
"we'll present some examples of how these issues presented themselves before "
"version 3.3 and show how these new features help address them."

"If you look carefully, you will see that ``x`` and ``y`` are both computed "
"at discrete times.  Furthermore, they are both sampled initially at the "
"start of the simulation and then again every 0.1 seconds.  But the question "
"is, are they really identical?  To help address this question, we include "
"the variable ``e`` which measures the difference between them."

"Simulating this model, we get the following trajectories for ``x`` and "
"``y``.  Of course, they look identical.  But in order to really determine if"
" there are any differences between them, let's plot the error value, ``e``:"

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/sampling.rst:42
msgid ""
"Here, we set up a common signal that triggers the assignment to both "
"variables.  In this way, we can be sure that when the ``tick`` signal "
"becomes true, both ``x`` and ``y`` will be assigned a value.  Sure enough, "
"if we run this model, we see that the error is always zero:"

"This kind of approach, where each signal is sampled based on a common "
"\"tick\" (or clock), is a good way to avoid determinism issues.  However, "
"what about cases where you have one signal that samples at a higher rate "
"than another, but you know that at certain times they should be sampled "
"together?  Consider the following example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/sampling.rst:60
msgid ""
"In this case, the variable ``tick`` is a counter.  Every time it changes, we"
" update the values of ``x`` and ``y``.  So this much is identical to the "
"previous models.  However, we added a third signal, ``z``, that is sampled "
"only when the value of ``tick`` is odd.  So ``x`` and ``y`` are sampled "
"twice as often.  But every time ``z`` is updated, we can be sure that ``x`` "
"and ``y`` are updated at exactly the same time.  Simulating this model gives"
" us:"

"This is the approach taken in Modelica prior to version 3.3.  But version "

"Now, instead of relying on a ``when`` statement, we use an enhanced version "

"Note that we have done away with the ``0.1``.  We no longer see any mention "
"of the clock interval as a real number.  Instead, we use the ``Clock`` "
"operator to the define clock interval for ``x`` as a rational number.  This "
"is important because it allows us to do exact comparisons between clocks.  "
"This brings us to the next line:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/sampling.rst:101

"Again, we see the rational representation of the clock.  What this means, in"
" practice, is that the Modelica compiler can know for certain that these two"
" clocks, ``x`` and ``y``, are identical because they are defined in terms of"
" integer quantities which allow exact comparison. This means that when "
"executing a simulation, we can know for certain that these two clocks will "
"trigger simultaneously."

"If we wanted to create a clock that was exactly two times slower than ``x``,"
" we can use the ``subSample`` operator to accomplish this.  We see this in "
"the definition of ``z``:"

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/sampling.rst:116
msgid ""
"Behind the scenes, the Modelica compiler can reason about these clocks.  It "
"knows that the ``x`` clock triggers every :math:`\\frac{1}{10}` of a second."
"  Using the information provided by the ``subSample`` operator the Modelica "
"compiler can therefore deduce that ``z`` triggers every "
":math:`\\frac{2}{10}` of a second. Conceptually, this means that ``z`` could"
" also have been defined as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/sampling.rst:127

"But by defining ``z`` using the ``subSample`` operator and defining it with "
