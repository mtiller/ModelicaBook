"it is entirely possible that ``sqrt`` will be called with a negative "

"Remember, the time at which a *time event* will occur is known in advance.  "

"The important thing to understand is that **until the event occurs, the "
"behavior doesn't change**.  In other words, the two sides of this ``if`` "
"expression represent two types of behavior, ``der(x)=sqrt(x)`` and "
"``der(x)=0``.  Since ``x`` is initially greater than zero, the initial "
"behavior is ``der(x)=sqrt(x)``.  **The solver will continue using this "
"equation until it has determined the time of the event** represented by "
"``x>=0``.  In order to determine the time of that event, **it must go past "
"the point where the value of the conditional expression changes**.  This "
"means that while attempting to determine precisely when the condition "

"The Modelica compiler collects all the zero crossing functions in the model "

"uses the solution it computed during that step to interpolate the zero "
"crossing function to find the location, in time, of the root of the zero "
"crossing function and this is the point in time where the event occurs.  "
"This process is much more efficient because the root finding algorithms have"
" more information to help them identify to location of the root (information"
" like the derivative of the zero crossing function) and evaluation is very "
"cheap because it doesn't involve taking additional integration steps, only "
"evaluating the interpolation functions from the triggering integration step."

"But after all this, it still isn't clear how to avoid the problems we saw in"
" the ``Decay1`` and ``Decay2`` models.  The answer is a special operator "
"called ``noEvent``.  The ``noEvent`` operator suppresses this special event "
"handling.  Instead, it does what most users expected would happen in the "
"first place, which is to evaluate the conditional expression for every value"
" of ``x``.  We can see the ``noEvent`` operator in action in the following "

"It might seems strange that we have to explicitly include the ``noEvent`` "
"operator in order to get what we consider the most intuitive behavior.  Why "
"not make the default behavior the most intuitive one?  The answer is "
"performance.  Using conditional expressions to generate events improves the "
"performance of the simulations by giving the solver clues about when to "
"expect abrupt changes in behavior.  Most of the time, this approach doesn't "
"cause any problem.  The examples we have presented in this chapter were "
"designed to highlight this issue, but they are not representative of most "
"cases.  For this reason, ``noEvent`` is not the default, but must be used "

"This kind of model can introduce an effect known as \"chattering\". "
"Chattering is simply the degradation in simulation performance due to a "

"solution asymptotically approaches a point where an event occurs.  This is "
"not uncommon, so it is important to watch out for such cases because they "
"can unnecessarily slow down simulations.  The important thing about the "
