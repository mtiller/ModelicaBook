"In the :ref:`previous example <cooling-revisited>`, we saw how some events "

"event.  In this section, we'll examine the other type of event, the state "
"event.  A state event is an event that depends on the solution trajectory."

"What makes this example interesting are the equations.  Specifically, the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/bouncing.rst:58
msgid ""
"A ``when`` statement is composed of two parts.  The first part is a "
"conditional expression that indicates the moment the event takes place.  In "
"this case, the event will take place \"when\" the height, ``h``, first drops"
" below ``0``.  The second part of the ``when`` statement is what happens "
"when the event occurs.  In this case, the value of ``v`` is re-initialized "
"via the ``reinit`` operator.  The ``reinit`` operator allows us to specify a"
" new initial condition for a state.  Conceptually, you can think of "
"``reinit`` as being like an ``initial equation`` inserted in the middle of a"
" simulation.  But it only changes one variable and it always sets it "
"explicitly (*i.e.,* it isn't as flexible as an ``initial equation``).  In "
"this case, the ``reinit`` statement will reinitialize the value of ``v`` to "
"be in the opposite direction of the value of ``v`` before the collision, "
"represented by ``pre(v)``, and scaled by the factor ``e``."

"Assuming that ``h0`` has a positive value, the relentless pull of gravity "
"ensures that the ball will eventually hit the surface. Running the "
"simulation for the case where ``h0`` is 1.0, we see the following behavior "
"from this model:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/bouncing.rst:88
msgid ""
"As such, the simulation proceeds assuming the ball is in free fall until it "
"identifies a solution trajectory where the value of the conditional ``h<0`` "
"changes during a time step.  When such a step occurs, the solver must "
"determine the precise time when the value of the conditional expression "
"becomes true.  Once that time has been identified, it computes the state of "
"the system at that time, processes the statements within the ``when`` "
"statement (*e.g.* any ``reinit`` statements) that affect the state of the "
"system and then **restarts** the integration starting from these computed "
"states.  In the case of the bouncing ball, the ``reinit`` statement is used "
"to compute a new post-collision value for ``v`` that sends the ball "
"(initially) upward again."

"But it is important to keep in mind that, in general, the solutions for most"
" Modelica models are derived using numerical methods.  As we shall see "
"shortly, this has some profound implications when we consider discrete "
"behavior.  This is because at the heart of all events (time or state events)"
" are conditional expressions, like ``h<0`` from our current example."

"The answer, as we hinted at before, lies in the numerical handling of the "
"when condition ``h<0``.  More specifically, what do we do if we start a "
"state extremely close to an event?  Because of numerical imprecision, we do "
"not know whether we are starting our step right after an event has just "
"occurred or whether we are starting a step where an event is just about to "
"occur."

"To address this problem, we must introduce a certain amount of hysteresis "
"(dead-banding).  What this means in this case is that once the condition "
"``h<0`` has become true, we have to get \"far enough\" away from the "
"condition before we allow the event to happen again.  In other words, the "
"event happens whenever ``h`` is less than zero.  But before we can trigger "
"the event again we require that ``h`` must first become greater than some "
":math:`\\epsilon`.  In other words, it is not simply enough that `h` becomes"
" greater than zero, `h` must become greater than :math:`\\epsilon` (where "
":math:`\\epsilon` is determined by the solver by examining various scaling "
"factors)."

"The problem in the previous simulations is that each time the ball bounces, "
"the peak value of `h` goes down a little bit.  By peak value, we mean the "
"value of `h` when the ball first begins to fall again. Eventually, the peak "
"value of `h` isn't enough to exceed the critical value of :math:`\\epsilon`."
"  This, in turn, means that the ``when`` statement never fires and the "
"``reinit`` statement will never again reset ``v``.  As a result, the ball "
"continues, indefinitely, in free fall."

"So this raises the obvious question of how to achieve the behavior we truly "
"intended (which is that the ball never drops below the surface).  For that, "
"we have to make a few minor changes to our model as follows:"

"It should be noted that there are many ways to solve this problem. The "
"solution presented here is only one of them.  In this approach, we have "
"effectively created two surfaces.  One at a height of ``0`` and the other at"
" a height of ``-eps`` (just below ``0``).  When the ball is bouncing "
"\"normally\" it will only trigger the first condition in our ``when`` "
"statement.  If, however, the ball does not rebound high enough after contact"
" and \"falls through\" the first surface, we detect that (and the fact that "
"it has fallen through) and set the ``done`` flag. The effect of the ``done``"
" flag is to effectively turn off gravity."

"In particular, note that it doesn't have just one conditional expression, "
"**but two**.  More specifically, it actually has a vector of conditional "
"expressions.  We'll introduce :ref:`vectors-and-arrays` later in the book, "
"but for now it is just important to point out that in this chapter we have "

"Remember our original statement that the vector notation for ``when`` "

"when **any** condition becomes true.  Assuming we run a simulation that "
"starts at ``time=0`` and runs until ``time=3``, then the ``when`` statement:"
msgstr ""

"will be triggered **twice**.  Once when ``time>1`` becomes true and the "
"other when ``time>2`` becomes true.  In contrast, in this case:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/bouncing.rst:241
msgid ""
"there is only a **single** conditional expression and it becomes true **only"
" once** (when ``time>1`` becomes true...and stays true).  The ``or`` "
"operator essentially masks the second conditional, ``time>2``, such that it "
"may as well not even be present in this particular case. In other words, "
"this conditional only **becomes true** once.  As a result, the statements "
"inside the ``when`` statement are only triggered once."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/bouncing.rst:249
msgid ""
"The key thing to remember is that for ``when`` statements, a vector of "
"conditionals means **any, not or**.  Furthermore, the statements are only "
"active at the instant when the conditional **becomes true**.  The "
"implications of this last statement will be discussed in greater details "
"later in this chapter when we talk about the important differences between "
":ref:`if-vs-when`."
