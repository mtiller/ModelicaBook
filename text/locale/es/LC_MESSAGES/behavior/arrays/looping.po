"One of the main uses of arrays is to allow code to be simplified through the"
" use of loops.  So we will conclude this chapter on arrays by introducing "
"some basic looping constructs and showing how they are used in conjunction "
"with array features."

"In general, the ``for`` keyword is used to represent looping.  But there are"
" many different contexts in which ``for`` can be used. Several of the "
"examples in this chapter used ``for`` to generate a collection of equations."
"  When ``for`` is used within an equation section, any equations contained "
"within the ``for`` loop are generated **for each value of the loop index "
"variables**.  In this way, we can easily generate many equations that have "
"the same overall structure and only vary by the value of the loop index "
"variable.  The general syntax for a ``for`` loop in an equation section is:"

"Note that the loop index variable (*e.g.,* ``i`` in this case) **does not "
"have to be declared**.  It is also worth noting that these variables only "
"exists within the scope of the ``for`` loop (not before or after the loop)."

"Another case where the ``for`` keyword can be seen is in our discussion of "
":ref:`array-comprehensions`.  In that case, the ``for`` construct is not "
"used to generate equations or statements, but to populate the various "
"elements in an array."

"There is another type of loop in Modelica and that is the ``while`` loop.  "
"The ``while`` loop is not used very often in Modelica.  The reason is that "
"Modelica, unlike a general purpose language, is an equation oriented "
"language.  Furthermore, it imposes a requirement that a model should include"
" an equal number of equations and unknowns.  Such a model is considered a "
"\"balanced model\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/looping.rst:66
msgid ""
"The reason that the ``while`` construct is not widely used is because a "
"balanced model requires that the number of equations is predictable (by the "
"compiler).  Because a ``for`` loop is bounded and the number of values of "
"the index variable is always known (because it is always derived from a "
"vector of possible values), the number of equations it will generate is "
"always known.  The same cannot be said of a ``while`` loop.  As such, "
"``while`` loops are only practical in the context of :ref:`algorithm-"
"sections` (typically in the definition of :ref:`functions`)."
