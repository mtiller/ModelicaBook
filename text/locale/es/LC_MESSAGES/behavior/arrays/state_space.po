"The matrices in this problem are the so-called \"ABCD\" matrices.  This ABCD"
" form is useful because there are several interesting calculations that can "
"be performed once a system is in this form.  For example, using the "
":math:`A` matrix, we can compute the natural frequencies of the system.  "
"Using various combinations of these matrices, we can determine several very "
"important properties related to control of the underlying system (*e.g.,* "
"observability and controllability)."

"This form is often called the \"LTI\" form.  The LTI form is important "
"because, in addition to having the same special properties as the ABCD form,"
" the LTI form can be used as a very simple form of \"model exchange\".  "
"Historically, when someone derived the behavior equations for a given system"
" (either by hand or using some modeling tool), one way they could import "
"those equations into other tools was to put them in the LTI form.  This "
"means that the model could be exchanged, shared or published as a series of "
"matrices with either numbers or expressions in them.  Today, technologies "
"like Modelica and `FMI <http://fmi-standard.org>`_ provide much better "
"options for model exchange."

"If someone gave us a model in LTI form, how would we express that in "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/state_space.rst:80
msgid ""
"The first step in this model is to declare the parameters ``nx``, ``nu`` and"
" ``ny``.  These represent the number of states, inputs and outputs, "
"respectively.  Next, we define the matrices ``A``, ``B``, ``C`` and ``D``.  "
"Because we are creating a model for a linear, time-invariant representation "
"all of these matrices can be parameters. We know that ``A``, ``B``, ``C`` "
"and ``D`` are arrays because their declarations followed by ``[`` and ``]``."
"  We know they are matrices because within the ``[]``\\ s there are two "
"dimensions given.  Finally, we see declarations for ``x0``, ``x``, ``u`` and"
" ``y``.  These are also arrays.  But in this case, they are vectors, since "
"they each have only a single dimension."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/state_space.rst:92
msgid ""
"Another thing to note about this model is that all parameters have been "
"given default values.  For ``nx``, ``nu`` and ``ny``, the assumption is that"
" the number of states, inputs and outputs is zero by default.  For the "
"matrices, we assume that they are filled with zeros by default.  Similarly, "
"for initial conditions we assume that all states start the simulation with a"
" value of zero unless otherwise specified.  We shall see shortly how these "
"assumptions make it possible for us to write very simple models by simply "
"overriding the values for these parameters."

"The rest of the model should look pretty familiar by now.  One thing that is"
" important to point out is the fact that the equations in this model are all"
" **vector** equations.  An equation in Modelica can involve scalars or "
"arrays.  The only requirement is that both side of the equation have the "
"same number of dimensions and the same size for each dimension.  So in the "
"case of the ``LTI`` model, we have the following initial equation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/state_space.rst:117
msgid ""
"This equation is a vector equation that expresses the fact that each element"
" in ``x`` has the corresponding value in ``x0`` at the start of a "
"simulation.  In practice, what happens is that each element in these vectors"
" is automatically expanded into a series of scalar equations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/state_space.rst:122
msgid ""
"Another thing that helps keep these equations readable is that Modelica has "
"some special rules regarding :ref:`vectorization` of functions.  In a "
"nutshell, these rules say that if you have a function that works with "
"scalars, you can automatically use it with vectors as well.  If you do, "
"Modelica will automatically apply the function to each element in the "
"vector.  So, for example, the expression ``der(x)`` in the ``LTI`` model is "
"a vector where each element in the vector represents the derivative of the "
"respective element of ``x``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/state_space.rst:131
msgid ""
"Finally, many of the typical algebraic operators like ``+``, ``-`` and ``*``"
" have special meanings when applied to vectors and matrices. These "
"definitions are designed so that they correspond with conventional "
"mathematical notation.  So in the ``LTI`` model, the expression ``A*x`` "
"corresponds to a matrix-vector product."

"With all this in mind, let's revisit several of our previous examples to see"

msgid ""
"When we extend from ``LTI``, we only need to specify the parameter values "
"that are different from the default values.  In this case, we specify that "
"there is one state and one input.  Then we specify `A` and `B` as 1x1 "
"matrices.  Finally, since we have an input, we need to provide an equation "
"for it.  The input can, in general, be time-varying so we don't represent it"
" as a parameter, but rather with an equation.  Note that in the equation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/state_space.rst:164
msgid ""
"the expression ``{1}`` is a vector literal.  This means that we are building"
" a vector as a list of its components.  In this case, the vector has only "
"one component, ``1``.  But we can build longer vectors using a comma "
"separated list of expressions, *e.g.,*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/state_space.rst:175
msgid ""
"It is worth noting that, in addition to setting parameter values, we also "
"can include equations in the ``extends`` statement.  So, we could have "
"avoided the ``equation`` section altogether and written the model more "
"compactly as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/state_space.rst:184

"In general, including the ``equation`` section makes the code a bit more "

"In all of these examples so far, we've used inheritance (via ``extends``) to"
" reuse the equations from the ``LTI`` model.  In general, there is a **much "
"better** way to reuse these equations which is to **treat them as sub-"
"components**.  To see how this is done, we will recast our previous "
":ref:`electrical examples <elec-example>` in LTI form.  But this time, we'll"

"Note that this time we do not use ``extends`` or inheritance of any kind.  "
"Instead, we actually declare a variable called ``rlc_comp`` that is of type "
"``LTI``.  Once we have finished covering all the basics of how to describe "
"different kinds of behavior in Modelica, we'll turn our attention to how to "
"organize all these equations into reusable :ref:`components`.  But for now, "
"this is just a \"sneak peak\" of (big) things to come."

"What we see in this `RLC` example is that we now have a variable called "

"Note that this equation means that we are providing an equation for the "

" later, we can use hierarchy to manage a considerable amount of complexity "
