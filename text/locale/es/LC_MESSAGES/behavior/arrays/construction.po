"Clearly, the variable ``x`` is (declared to be) a vector with three real "

"As we can see in both the Modelica code and the more mathematical "
"representation, the matrix ``B`` has two rows and three columns.  The syntax"
" for building arrays in this way is a bit more complicated than building "
"vectors.  Superficially, we see that while a vector is surrounded by ``{}``,"
" a matrix is surrounded by ``[]``.  But more importantly, a mixture of "
"commas **and semicolons** are used as delimiters.  The semicolons are used "
"to separate rows and the commas are used to separate the columns."

"When embedding vectors, it is very important to note that **vectors are "

"So far, we've discussed vectors and matrices.  But you can construct "

" a collection of vectors as follows:"

"As can be seen in this example, the inner most elements in this nested "
"construction correspond to the right most dimension in the declaration.  In "

"those three elements is a vector of 4 scalars."

"So far, we've shown how to construct vectors, matrices and higher "

" can see in the case of higher dimensional arrays, these constructions can "
"get very complicated.  Fortunately, Modelica includes array comprehensions "
"which provide a convenient syntax for programmatically constructing arrays."
"  This approach has two main benefits.  The first is that it is a much more "
"compact notation.  The second is that it allows us to easily express how the"
" values in the array are tied to the various indices."
