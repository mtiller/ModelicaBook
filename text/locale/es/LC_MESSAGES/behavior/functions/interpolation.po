"Note that the ``VectorTable`` inherits from the ``ExternalObject`` type.  An"

msgid ""
"The ``constructor`` function is invoked when an instance of a "
"``VectorTable`` is created (*e.g.,* the declaration of the ``vector`` "
"variable in our test case).  This ``constructor`` function is used to "
"initialize our opaque pointer.  Whatever data is required as part of that "
"initialization process should be passed as argument to the ``constructor`` "
"function.  That same data should be present during instantiation (*.e.g,* "
"the ``data`` argument in our declaration of the ``vector`` variable)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/functions/interpolation.rst:224
msgid ""
"The definition of the ``constructor`` function is unusual because, unlike "
"our previous examples, it does not include an ``algorithm`` section.  The "
"``algorithm`` section is normally used to compute the return value of the "
"function.  Instead, the ``constructor`` function has an ``external`` clause."
"  This indicates that the function is implemented in some other language "
"besides Modelica.  In this case, that other language is C (as indicated by "
"the ``\"C\"`` following the ``external`` keyword).  This tells use that the "
"``table`` variable (which is the ``output`` of this function and represents "
"the opaque pointer) is returned by a C function named ``createVectorTable`` "
"which is passed the contents and size of the ``ybar`` variable."

"The essential point here is that from the point of view of the Modelica "

"The ``destructor`` function is invoked whenever the ``ExternalObject`` is no"

" model will generally persist until the end of the simulation.  But an "
"``ExternalObject`` declared as a ``protected`` variable in a function, for "

"``VectorTable`` instance should be freed by the call to ``destructor``.  "

"First, the ``struct`` called ``VectorTable`` is the data associated wit the "

"data points, ``npoints``, and a cached value for the last used index, "
"``lastIndex``."

"Next, we see the ``createVectorTable`` function which allocates an instance "

"``createVectorTable``."

"Finally, we see the function ``interpolateVectorTable``.  This is a C "
"function that is passed an instance of the ``VectorTable`` structure and a "
"value for the independent variable and returns the interpolated value for "
"the dependent variable.  This function performs almost exactly the same "
"function as the ``InterpolateVector`` function presented earlier.  The "
"Modelica runtime provides functions like ``ModelicaFormatError`` so that "
"external C code can report errors.  In the case of "
"``interpolateVectorTable``, these functions are used to implement the "
"assertions we saw previously in ``InterpolateVector``. The lookup of ``i`` "

"``interpolateVectorTable``."

"We mentioned previously that ``VectorTable`` is opaque and that Modelica "

"An important thing to note about the ``ExternalObject`` approach, which "
