"This book started as a Kickstarter project.  The idea of writing a book and "
"making it freely available, under a Creative Commons license, was largely "
"inspired by the writings of Cory Doctorow and Lawrence Lessig.  Their "
"message of sharing resonated very strongly with me. I'm not interested in "
"capitalizing on my knowledge of Modelica, I want to share it with others so "
"they can experience the same joy I do in exploring this subject.  Happily, "
"this Kickstarter project was successfully funded on December 4th, 2012 and "
"my odyssey to create an entire Creative Commons licensed book began.  If "
"circumstances had been different, this book would probably be dedicated to "
"Cory Doctorow and Lawrence Lessig for inspiring me to take on this project."

"But this book isn't dedicated to them.  Instead, it is dedicated to **Aaron "
"Swartz**.  Aaron was without a doubt a wunderkind.  At the age of 14, Aaron "
"participated in the development of the RSS standard.  He went on to start "
"his own company, Infogami, that was eventually acquired by Reddit.  Along "
"the way, he worked on the Creative Commons License and fought against "
"Internet censorship.  He was both brilliant and successful yet he was also "
"altruistic and cared deeply about technology and the future of mankind.  He "
"had countless qualities that I admire and aspire to.  But on January 11th, "
"2013, Aaron Swartz took his own life."

"Barely a month after the successful funding of my Kickstarter project, Aaron"
" Swartz was dead at the age of 26.  It is astounding what Aaron managed to "
"accomplish in his young life and it makes his death all the more tragic to "
"think of all the good he could have done with the rest of his life.  Aaron, "
"despite being almost 20 years younger than me, had helped blaze the trail "
"for me, this book project and, ultimately, those reading this book through "
"his work with RSS, Creative Commons, the Internet, and so on.  It was "
"heartbreaking that just as this project started, his life ended.  I resolved"
" then to dedicate this book to him."

"This book is dedicated to Aaron Swartz in an attempt to keep his memory and,"
" more importantly, the things he stood for alive.  Over a year has past "
"since he died but I haven't forgotten Aaron Swartz and I hope this "
"dedication reminds people what he stood for.  We need to learn from this "
"tragedy and make sure our governments understand that people like Aaron "
"Swartz, while perhaps passionate and overzealous, don't deserve to be "
"prosecuted and treated like criminals.  They deserve guidance and coaching "
"on ways to channel their abundant energies and talents to help society."
