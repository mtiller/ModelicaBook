"This book is the culmination of so many lectures, books, discussions, "

"On the subject of Modelica, the primary acknowledgment has to be to Hilding "
"Elmqvist for not only having the technical vision to recognize the potential"
" impact that symbolic manipulation techniques could have on solving "
"engineering problems but having the leadership to push this vision forward "
"as an open standard.  Hilding is the undisputed \"father of Modelica\" and "
"he deserves considerable credit for all that Modelica has become."

"Second only to Hilding is Martin Otter, a man who has worked tirelessly for "
"the advancement of Modelica.  I can honestly say that Martin works harder "
"than anybody else I know.  He has not only made countless technical "
"contributions to Modelica, but he's taken on the unenviable and generally "
"thankless task of managing the Modelica Association.  It is important to "
"remember that having great technical ideas is by no means a recipe for "
"success.  Somebody has to be there to push and push and push those ideas "
"along.  I'd like to thank Martin for all his hard work in making the "
"Modelica Association what it is today."

"Of course, Martin isn't alone in running the Modelica Association. The "
"Modelica Association Board and the Members are also extremely important for "
"raising awareness about Modelica.  In the end, the Modelica Association is "
"an organization committed to open standards that support engineering and I'd"
" like to thank all the members for their hard work in this regard."

"There wasn't always a Modelica Association, but there was always a Modelica "
"Design Group.  These are the people who come together several times a year "
"and work on continuously improving the Modelica language. It is astounding "
"how much time and energy people have volunteered toward this effort.  I'd "
"like to thank all those people who've participated in the development of the"
" Modelica Language and the Modelica Standard Library."

"On a personal note, I am forever indebted to my mother, my father, my wife, "
"my kids and my in-laws for their endless support of my passion for science, "
"engineering and math.  They are responsible for cultivating and sustaining "

"The very idea of a book that is available for free might seem radical to "
"some.  The basic premise of this project was largely inspired by listening "
"to and reading the works of Cory Doctorow and Lawrence Lessig.  I'd like to "
"thank them for opening my eyes to the idea of Creative Commons licensing.  "
"I'd also like to thank Dietmar Winkler for the many discussions we had on "
"alternative publishing models.  We would frequently discuss the ideas of "
"Doctorow and Lessig and how their ideas could be applied to the creation of "
"more accessible content for the Modelica world."

"Looking back, I feel very fortunate to have worked for several companies "
"that supported my involvement in Modelica.  I first got involved with "
"Modelica while I was working at Ford Motor Company and I was fortunate that "
"they were willing to sponsor my participation in many different Modelica "
"related events.  After Ford, I went to work at Emmeskay (eventually acquired"
" by LMS).  I benefited enormously from the interactions I had with my "
"Emmeskay family.  In particular, I'd like to thank my partners, Swami "
"Gopalswamy and Shiva Shivashankar for giving me the opportunity to be part "
"of Emmeskay and for being great friends.  While at Emmeskay, it was a "
"privilege to work with Michael Sasena and John Batteh on several Modelica "
"related projects.  Emmeskay was an incredible company and this was entirely "
"a reflection on the great group of people who worked there.  Finally, I'd "
"like to thank Dassault Systèmes for giving me the opportunity to work with "
"all the excellent people there as well.  In particular, I'd like to thank "
"Hilding Elmqvist and Marc Frouin for encouraging me to come work there.  I'd"
" also like to thank Martin Malmheden, Dag Brück and Sandrine Loembe for all "
"the good times during my excellent year in Paris."

"This project was really an experiment to see if the Kickstarter approach to "
