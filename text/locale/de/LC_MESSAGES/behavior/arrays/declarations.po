"Array declaration syntax is very simple.  The syntax is the same as for a "
"normal variable declaration except the variable name should be followed by "
"subscripts to specify the size of each dimension of the array.  The general "
"form for an array declaration would be:"

"where ``VariableType`` is a Modelica type like ``Real`` or ``Integer``, "

"As we will see shortly when we discuss the various :ref:`array-functions` in"

"we are declaring an array with two dimensions.  The size of the first "

"As we saw in our :ref:`chemical-system` examples, another way to specify the"

"to specify a dimension, then the size of that dimension will be equal to the"
" number of possible values for that enumeration.  In our forthcoming "
"discussion on :ref:`array-indexing`, we'll see how to properly index an "

"In this case, ``y`` will have one dimension of size 5.  The use of the "
