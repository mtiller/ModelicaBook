"The previous section discussed how to create component models in the heat "

"In this section we will implement the basic electrical component models "

"But in both cases, we'll use the same connector definitions.  In our "
"discussion of :ref:`simple-domains`, we saw how to construct an electrical "
"connector.  As with the previous section on heat transfer, the examples in "
"this section will rely on the connector definitions from the Modelica "
"Standard Library.  Those connector definitions look like this:"

"Given these ``connector`` definitions, it is relatively straightforward to "
"construct a resistor model.  The goal of a resistor model is to encapsulate "
"the relationship between the voltage across the resistor and the current "
"through the resistor using Ohm's law. The following model represents how one"
" might expect such a resistor model to look:"

"The important thing to notice about these models is the amount of common "
"code shared between them.  In software development, this kind of redundancy "
"is frowned upon.  In fact, a common software maxim is \"Redundancy is the "
"root of all evil\".  The reason this redundancy is a problem is partly "
"because you are doing the same work multiple times, but also because this "
"code needs to be *maintained* as well.  When you repeat code and then find a"
" mistake in that code, you have to fix it everywhere."

"This issue of redundancy is an important one.  So let's revisit building "
"models of resistors, inductors and capacitors with the goal of reducing the "
"amount of repeated code.  In software, there is something called the *DRY "
"principle* where DRY stands for \"Don't Repeat Yourself\".  So our next step"
" is to make our resistor, capacitor and inductor models DRY."

"The key to eliminating redundant code is to identify all the common code "
"between these models and create a ``partial`` model that we can inherit "
"from.  We highlighted the common lines previously.  Now we can capture them "
"in their own model as follows:"

"In summary, we've extracted the declarations for ``p``, ``n`` and ``v`` from"

"Finally, the conservation of charge equation is also included."

"There are several things to notice about this ``Resistor`` model.  The first"
" is how much shorter it is.  This is because we inherit the electrical pins,"
" the conservation of charge equation and the variables ``v`` and ``i`` from "
"the ``TwoPin`` model.  Another thing to notice is that, by leverage the "
"definitions of ``v`` and ``i``, Ohm's law looks just like it would if you "

"The ``Ground`` model has only one pin so it cannot inherit from ``TwoPin``."
"  Recall how we described the :ref:`amb-cond` model from our discussion on "
":ref:`heat-transfer-components` an infinite reservoir.  The ``Ground`` model"
