"In both of the examples we presented in this chapter, we used interface "
"definitions as part of the architecture definition process. The term "
"\"interface\" doesn't come from Modelica itself, it is a term common among "
"computer languages.  In Modelica, we can think of interfaces as models that "
"define all the details of the model **that are externally visible**.  You "
"can think of an interface as a \"shell\" without any internal details.  For "
"this reason, interface models are almost always marked as ``partial``."

"Another important concept is that of an \"implementation\".  This is another"
" term borrowed from the world of computer languages. Whereas an interface is"
" used to simply describe the externally visible aspects of a model, an "
"implementation includes internal details as well.  It includes the "
"information required to actually implement that interface.  In some cases, "
"it may only constitute a partial implementation (in which case it should "
"also be marked as ``partial``).  In other cases, it may represent the "
"architecture of a particular subsystem where further implementation details "
"are pushed one additional level down in the model hierarchy (another case of"
" a ``partial`` model).  But most of the time, these implementations will be "
"complete (non-``partial``) models for a particular subsystem."

"The most important thing we need to consider when we talk about interfaces "
"and implementations is the notion of **plug-compatibility**.  As we already "
"discussed in our elaboration of the :ref:`sensor-comparison` example, a "
"model ``X`` is plug-compatible with a model ``Y`` if for every **public** "
"variable in ``Y``, there is a corresponding public variable in ``X`` with "
"the same name. Furthermore, every such variable in ``X`` must itself be "
"plug-compatible with its counterpart in ``Y``.  This ensures that if you "
"change a component of type ``Y`` into a component of type ``X`` that "
"everything you need (parameters, connectors, etc) will still be there and "
"will still be compatible.  **However, please note** that if ``X`` is plug-"
"compatible with ``Y``, this **does not** imply that ``Y`` is plug-compatible"
" with ``X`` (as we will see in a moment)."

"Generally speaking, most cases where we concern ourselves with plug-"
"compatibility revolve around whether a given implementation is plug-"
"compatible with a given interface.  As we've seen in these examples (and we "
"will review shortly), the configuration management features in Modelica "
"hinge on the relationship between interfaces and implementations and the "
"process by which configuration management is performed is centered around "
"plug-compatibility."

"The bottom line is that it is very useful to not only think in terms of "
"interface and implementation models, but also to create models to formally "
"define interfaces and distinguish them from implementations, since these "
"will be very useful when creating architecture driven models."
