"As we saw in the :ref:`thermal-control` example from this chapter, when "
"building architectures it can be difficult to define an interface that "
"covers all important configurations.  One option, in this case, is to use "
"``expandable`` connectors."

"An expandable connector uses exactly the same syntax as a normal connector "
"definition (see previous discussion on :ref:`connector-def`) with the "
"exception that the ``expandable`` qualifier is added before the definition, "
"*e.g.,*"

"We can ignore the ``expandable`` qualifier and just treat this connector "
"like a normal connector if we want.  The assumption is that components that "
"use such a connector as a normal connector will provide the correct number "
"of equations such that any component models are :ref:`balanced-components`."

"If, however, a user connects to a named element that is **not** part of the "
"connector definition, this causes a new element to be added to that "
"particular instance of the connector.  The type of this new element will be "
"identical to the connector it is connected to. Ultimately, that element will"
" be added to any other connector instances in the :ref:`connection set "
"<connection-sets>` as well."

"In this way, an ``expandable`` connector definition can be \"grown\" to add "
"additional signals not in the original definition.  In this way, any "
"interface definition with an expandable connector has the flexibility to "
"exchange more information than just what was in the initial connector "
"definition.  As we saw in the :ref:`thermal-control` example, this can be "
"very useful when the interface can vary significantly depending on the "
"choice of subsystems."

"By far, the most common use case for expandable connectors is to add "
"additional ``input`` and ``output`` signals to a connector.  This frequently"
" occurs because the information required when pairing controllers up with "
"sensors and actuators can change depending on the implementation details of "
"those subsystems.  For example, an internal combustion engine with cam "
"phasing will require a commanded cam angle from the controller.  But an "
"engine without this feature will not."

"However, the ``expandable`` connector can also be used with acausal sub-"
"connectors to add additional points of physical interaction between "
"subsystems.  For example, one subsystem may not include thermal effects "
"while another one does.  The one that does could include a thermal acausal "
"connector to allow other subsystems to interact thermally with it."

"Expandable connector definitions define a *minimum* set of variables that "
"should appear on the connector.  It is assumed that all component models "
"will be balanced with respect to those variables in the connector "
"definition.  In addition, additional variables can be added to an "
"``expandable`` connector as long as the overall system model is still "
"balanced.  Expandable connectors are typically used in conjunction with "
"interface definitions to define a minimum interface within an architecture "
"that can be expanded by the choice of implementations."
