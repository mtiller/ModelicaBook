"As we will see in the coming chapters, such connector definitions are very "
"convenient when modeling physical systems because they enable the Modelica "
"compiler to automatically generate conservation equations for networks of "

"It should be noted that a ``connector`` definition can mix causal, acausal "
"and parameter variables all in the same connector.  In fact, a variable in a"
" connector **can itself be a connector** as well.  This richness of "
"expressiveness in Modelica allows users to model a range of different types "
"of interactions and choose, on a variable by variable basis, the semantics "
"that make the most sense for each potential interaction."

"应该指出的是，单个\\ ``connector``\\ 定义可以都在同一个连接器内混合因果、非因果和参数变量。\ "

"**本身可以也是一个连接器**\\ 。\ "
"Modelica的丰富表现力允许用户模拟一系列不同类型的相互作用，以及为每个变量选择对潜在相互作用最有意义的语义。\ "
