"When describing the appearance of a Modelica entity, there are two different"

"icon representation is used when viewing something from the \"outside\".  "
"Generally, the icon includes some distinctive visual representation along "
"with additional information about that entity added via :ref:`substitutions`"
" (which we will be covering shortly)."

"有两种不同的表现形式可以去描述Modelica的实体的外观。\ "
