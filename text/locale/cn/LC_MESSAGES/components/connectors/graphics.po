"Until now, we've discussed Modelica as a purely textual language.  But the "

"首先我们从连接器的可视化开始。\ "
"Modelica模型的文本组件将始终存在。\ "

"The first kind of graphical association we will introduce will be the "

"When we associate an annotation with a definition, we place it in the "

"要让一个标注和定义关联起来，我们要将其放置在该定义内。\ "

"Note the length of each of these definitions.  The length is due almost "

"We will be discussing :ref:`graphical-annos` shortly.  But let's take a "
"quick look at what is going on in these definitions.  We can see that the "
"``Icon`` annotation contains another variable ``graphics``.  The "
"``graphics`` variable is assigned a vector of graphical elements.  We see "
"that this vector graphical elements includes an ``Ellipse`` (used to render "
"the circle in the icon), two ``Rectangle`` elements (used to render the "
"\"+\" sign) and a ``Text`` element.  Note the ``textString`` field in the "
"``Text`` element contains ``\"%name\"``.  There are a number of substitution"
" patterns that can appear in a graphical annotation.  This particular one "
"will be filled in with the instance name whenever a variable is declared "
"with the type ``PositivePin``. So, for example, the following declarations:"

"我们很快将要讨论\\ :ref:`graphical-annos`\\ 。\ "
"但是，让我们先快速浏览下这些定义有什么用。\ "
"我们可以看到，\\ ``Icon``\\ 标注包含另一个变量\\ ``graphics``\\ 。\ "
"\\ ``graphics``\\ 变量的赋值是一系列图形元素组成的向量。\ "
"我们看到，这些矢量图形元素包括\\ ``Ellipse``\\ （用于呈现图标内圆圈）、两个\\ "
"``Rectangle``\\ 元素（用于渲染“+”号）和\\ ``Text``\\ 元素。\ "
"注意，\\ ``Text``\\ 内的元素\\ ``textString``\\ 包含了\\ ``\"%name\"``\\ 代码。\ "
"图形标注中能填入不同的替换字符串。\ "
"上述的替换字符串则指代声明为\\ ``PositivePin``\\ 类型的变量实例名称。\ "
"因此，例如在下面的声明有："

"way, the textual names assigned to connectors in a diagram always match the "

":ref:`graphical-annos` will be reviewed in detail later in this chapter and "

"本章后面我们会回顾关于\\ :ref:`graphical-annos`\\ 的内容。\ "
