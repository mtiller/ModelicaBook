#: ../../source/components/connectors/simple_domains.rst:29
msgid ""
"The first constraint is that the through variable should be the time "

"that the through variable will be used to formulate generalized conservation"
" equations in our system.  As such, it is essential that the through "
"variables be conserved quantities."
msgstr ""
"第一个约束条件要求穿越变量应为某个守恒量的时间导数。\ "
"这样做的原因是穿越变量会被用于建立系统的广义守恒方程。\ "
"因此，穿越变量为守恒量的导数便至关重要。\ "

#: ../../source/components/connectors/simple_domains.rst:35
msgid ""
"The second constraint is that the across variable should be the lowest order"
" derivative to appear in any of our constitutive or empirical equations in "
"the domain.  So, for example, we chose position for translational motion "
"because position is used in describing the behavior of a spring (*i.e.,* "
"Hooke's law).  If we had chosen velocity (the derivative of position with "
"respect to time), then we would have been in the awkward situation of trying"
" to describe the behavior of a spring in terms of velocities, not positions."
"  An essential point here is that **differentiation is lossy**.  If we know "
"position, we can easily express velocity.  But if we only know velocity, we "
"cannot compute position without knowing an additional integration constant. "
"This is why we want to work with across variables that have not been overly "
"differentiated."
msgstr ""
"第二个约束条件则要求横跨变量应为领域内所有本构方程和经验公式内的最低阶导数。\ "
"因此，举个例子，在平移运动时我们选择位置作为横跨变量，因为位置会用于描述弹簧的行为（即胡克定律）。\ "
"如果我们选择了速度（位置的时间导数），那么我们就会一直处于一种尴尬局面。\ "
"对比起位置，我们必须试图用速度去描述弹簧行为。\ "
"这里有一点很重要的：\\"
" **微分操作是有损的**\\ 。\ "
"如果知道位置，我们可以很容易地表达速度。\ "
"但倘若只知道速度，而没有额外的积分常数，我们就不能计算位置。\ "
"这就是为什么我们希望横跨变量不要经过太多次微分。\ "
