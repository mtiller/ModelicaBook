"So far, we've talked primarily about how to model behavior.  What we've seen"
" so far are models composed largely of textual equations.  But from this "
"point forward, we will be exploring how to create reusable component models."
"  So instead of writing Ohm's law whenever we wish to model a resistor, "
"we'll instead add an instance of a **resistor** component model to our "
"system."
msgstr ""
"到目前为止，我们的讨论主要关于对行为的建模。\ "
"我们至此看到的大多是由方程代码所组成的模型。\ "
"但从现在开始，我们将探讨如何创建可重用的组件模型。\ "
"因此，我们将不再在每次模拟电阻都写出欧姆定律。\ "
"相反，我们将把\ **电阻**\ 组件模型的实例添加到系统里。\ "

"Until now, the models that we've shown have all been self contained. All the"
" behavior of our entire system was captured in a single model and "
"represented by textual equations.  But this approach does not scale well.  "
"What we really want is the ability to create reusable component models."
msgstr ""
"到现在为止，我们看到的模型全部都是完整的。\ "
"整个系统的所有行为均囊括在单个模型内，且通过方程代码来表示。\ "

"But before we can dive into how to create these components, we need to first"
" discuss how we will be connecting them together.  The component models that"
" we will be building during the remainder of the book are still represented "
"by a ``model`` definition.  What sets them apart from the models we have "
"seen so far is that they will feature **connectors**."

"但在研究我们如何可以创建这些部件之前，我们需要先讨论如何将部件连接在一起。\ "
"我们在本书的其余部分也会继续讨论组件模型。\ "
"这些组件模型仍将表示为\ ``model``\ 定义。\ "

"A ``connector`` is a way for one model to exchange information with another "

"In order to understand one specific class of connector semantics, it is "

"physical systems.  An acausal approach to physical modeling identifies two "
"distinct classes of variables."

"为了明白一类特定接口的语义，首先要了解物理系统的非因果表示方式。\ "
"非因果物理建模方法区分了两类不同的变量。\ "

"The first class of variables we will discuss are \"across\" variables (also "
"called *potential* or *effort* variables).  Differences in the values of "
"across variables across a component are what trigger components to react.  "
"Typical examples of across variables, that we will be discussing shortly, "
"are temperature, voltage and pressure. Differences in these quantities "
"typically lead to dynamic behavior in the system."
msgstr ""
"我们将讨论的第一类变量是“横跨”变量（也称为\ *势*\ 或\ *功用变量*\ ）。\ "
"横跨变量跨越部件时的增减值就是让部件运动的原因。\ "
"横跨变量的典型例子有温度、电压和压力。\ "
"我们将马上对这些变量进行讨论。\ "
"这些量的差异值通常会导致在系统的动态行为。\ "

#: ../../source/components/connectors.rst:63
msgid ""
"The second class of variables we will discuss are \"through\" variables "
"(also called *flow* variables).  Flow variables normally represent the flow "
"of some conserved quantity like mass, momentum, energy, charge, *etc.*  "
"These flows are usually the result of some difference in the across "
"variables across a component model.  For example, current flowing through a "
"resistor is in response to a voltage difference across the two sides of the "
"resistor.  As we will see in many of the examples to come, there are many "
"different types of relationships between the through and across variables "
"(Ohm's law being just one of many)."
msgstr ""
"我们将讨论的第二类变量是“穿越”变量（也称为\ *流*\ 变量）。\ "
"流变量通常代表了一些保守量，如质量、动量、能量、电荷等等。\ "
"这些流通常是横跨变量在跨越部件时有差值的结果。\ "
"例如，通过电阻的电流流动是由于电阻两侧的电压差。\ "
"正如我们将在许多例子中看到的一样，穿越变量与横跨变量间有很多种不同的关系（欧姆定律仅是冰山一角）。\ "

"It is extremely important to know that Modelica follows a convention that a "

"models of :ref:`components`)."
msgstr ""
"一定一定要知道Modelica遵从如下的正负号规则：穿越变量的正值表示守恒量在流\ **入**\ 某个组件。\ "
