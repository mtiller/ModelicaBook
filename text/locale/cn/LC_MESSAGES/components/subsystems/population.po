"This model looks at the population of both rabbits and foxes in the "
"connected regions and specifies a rate of migration that is proportional to "
"the difference in population between the regions.  In other words, if there "
"are more rabbits in one region than another, the rabbits will move from the "
"more populated region to the less population region.  This is effectively a "
"\"diffusion\" model of migration and does not necessarily have a basis in "
"ecology.  It is introduced simply as an example of how we could add "
"additional effects, on top of those implemented in each region, to change "
"the population dynamics between regions."
