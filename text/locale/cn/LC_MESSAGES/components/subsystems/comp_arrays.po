"本章中有数个示例使用了组件数组。\ "

"创建组件数组和我们前面在\ :ref:`vectors-and-arrays`\ "

"However, unlike scalars, components have other declarations inside them.  So"
" whenever an array of components is created, the structure of that component"
" is replicated for each component in the array. Modelica imposes a "
"restriction that in every array, every element must be the same type.  This "
"may seem obvious, but that is partly because we haven't discussed "
"``replaceable`` components yet.  We'll learn more about ``replaceable`` "
"components in the next chapter when we talk about Modelica's :ref"
":`configuration-management` features.  But for now we will simply point out "
"that it is not possible to ``redeclare`` only one element in an array."
msgstr ""
"然而，和标量不同，部件内会有其他声明。\ "
"因此，在创建分量的数组时，数组中每个组件的结构都会被复制。\ "
"Modelica要求数组中的每一个元素都必须为相同的类型。\ "
"这似乎是显而易见的。\ "
"但这一定程度上是因为我们还没有讨论过\"
" ``replaceable``\ 部件。\ "
"我们会了解更多关于\ ``replaceable``\ 组件在下一章当我们谈论的Modelica的\ "
":ref:`configuration-management`\ 特性。\ "
"不过现在，我们只会简单地指出，只\ ``redeclare``\ "
"数组中的一个元素是不可能的。\ "

"As we touched on briefly in our discussion of :ref:`harmonic-motion`, when "
"we make :ref:`sub-modifications` to arrays of components, each variable "
"inside the component is implicitly treated as an array.  For example, "
"consider the following ``record`` definition:"

"正如在\ :ref:`harmonic-motion`\ 讨论里简要地谈到的一样，我们在对组件数组进行\ :ref:`sub-"

"If we were to declare an array of ``Point`` components, *e.g.,* ``Point "
"p[5]``, any reference to ``p.x`` is treated as an array of 5 ``Real`` "
"variables, *i.e.,* ``p[1].x``, ``p[2].x``, ``p[3].x``, ``p[4].x`` and "
"``p[5].x``.  This is called *slicing*.  The bottom line is that if we leave "
"off a subscript (*e.g.,* ``p.x``), it gets \"pushed to the end\" (or more "
"technically, it is left \"unbound\" and can be \"bound\" later).  Also, if a"
" subscript is supplied as a range (*e.g.,* ``:``, ``1:end``, ``2:3``), then "
"the expression resolves to a subset of the array corresponding to the "
"indices in the range.  All of this holds even for arrays of components "
"containing arrays of components and so on."
msgstr ""
"假设我们声明\ ``Point``\ 组件的数组，如\ ``Point p[5]``\ 。\ "
"那么，任何对\ ``p.x``\ 的引用都会被视为有5个\ ``Real``\ 变量的数组，\ "
"即\ ``p[1].x``\ 、\ ``p[2].x``\ 、\ ``p[3].x``\ 、\ ``p[4].x``\ 以及\ ``p[5].x``\ 。\ "
"这就是所谓的\ *切片*\ 。\ "
"最重要的一点是，如果我们省略下标（如\ ``p.x``\ "
"），那么下标就对应所有的元素（在技术上说，下标维持在“未限定”状态。\ "
"而随后则可以“限定”下标）。\ "
"此外，如果提供的下标为一个范围（例如\ ``：``\"
" 、\ ``1:end``\ 、\ ``2:3``\ "
"），那么表达式则会解析为对应于该范围内所有索引的数组子集。\ "
"上述内容对于含有组件数组的组件数组也一样成立。\ "
