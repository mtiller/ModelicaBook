"So far, we've presented all of the models without any real discussion of how"
" to properly organize them.  In some cases, like the "
"``NewtonCoolingWithTypes`` example in our discussion on :ref:`adding "
"physical type information <physical-types>`, it is awkward to keep "
"everything within a single model.  There are many cases where the same "
"information gets repeated in multiple models and this makes maintaining "
"those models very difficult."

"到目前为止，我们已经介绍了所有类型的模型，而没有任何真正讨论过如何正确地对模型进行组织。\ "
"在某些情况下，如在\ ``NewtonCoolingWithTypes``\ 例子讨论\ :ref:`\ 添加物理量类型信息\ <physical-types>`\ 时，"
"把所有信息放在单一的模型内实在有些奇怪。\ "
"有许多情况，相同的信息在多个模型里被重复，这使得对这些模型的维护变得非常困难。\ "

"The good news is that many of these previous examples can be greatly "
"improved by leveraging the ``package`` system in Modelica.  A ``package`` is"
" conceptually like a directory.  It holds a collection of Modelica entities."
"  These entities can then be referenced or imported to avoid duplication."
msgstr ""
"好消息是，许多这样的前述例子能够通过借助Modelica的\ ``package``\ 系统得到极大改善。\ "
"\ ``package``\ 在概念上类似于目录。\ "
"它包含一系列Modelica实体的集合。\ "
"通过引用或者导入这些实体，我们就可以避免重复。\ "

"This chapter provides several examples that demonstrate how to use the "
"package features in Modelica.  This chapter will conclude with a discussion "
"of the :ref:`msl`, which contains an enormous amount of reusable content "
"that is available to all Modelica tools."
