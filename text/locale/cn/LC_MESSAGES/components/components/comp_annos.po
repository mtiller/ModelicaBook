"The ``tab`` field is a string that indicates the name of the tab that this "

"of a \"group\" **within the specified tab** in which the variable should be "
"placed.  The ``enable`` field should be given an expression that indicates "
"when the parameter should be shown.  The ``showStartAttribute`` field can be"
" used to incorporate the ``start`` attributes value (for this variable) into"
" the user interface so the user can easily specify the value of the "
"``start`` attribute.  The ``groupImage`` field allows the user to specify an"
" image to associate with the group named by the ``group`` field.  Finally, "
"the ``connectorSizing`` is only useful in declarations for integer "
"parameters that are used to specify the size of arrays of connectors. In "
"such circumstances, if the value of the ``connectorSizing`` field is "
"``true``, the graphical environment **may** update the value of the "
"annotated parameter in response to any action that impacts the necessary "
"size of that connector."
