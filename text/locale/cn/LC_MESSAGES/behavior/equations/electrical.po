"This further emphasizes the point that in Modelica it is not necessary to "

msgstr ""
"这也进一步强调了，Modelica不同于其他的建模环境。\ "
"我们完全没有必要把方程变成所谓的“显式状态空间形式”。\ "

"Ultimately, these equations will probably need to be manipulated into a form"
" like explicit state-space form.  But if such manipulations are necessary, "

" model developer to deal with this tedious, time consuming and error prone "
"task."
msgstr ""
"最终，这些方程可能需要转换成类似显式状态空间的形式。\ "
"但是，如果这样的转换是必须的，那么，这将是Modelcia语言编译器的工作，而不需要模型开发者去做。\ "

"The ability to keep equations in their \"textbook form\" is important "
"because, as we will show in later sections, we eventually want to get to the"
" point where these equations are \"captured\" in individual components "
"models.  In those cases, we won't know (when we create the component model) "
"exactly what variable each equation will be used to solve for.  Making such "
"manipulations the responsibility of the Modelica compiler not only makes the"
" model development faster and easier, but it dramatically improves the "
"**reusability** of the models."

"将方程保存成其自有“教科书形式”这一功能非常重要。\ "
