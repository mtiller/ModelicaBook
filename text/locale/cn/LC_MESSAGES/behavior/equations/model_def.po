"A ``model`` definition is the most generic type of definition in Modelica.  "
"Later in the book (and even in this chapter), we'll be introducing other "
"types of definitions (*e.g.,* ``record`` definitions) that share the same "
"syntax as a ``model`` definition, but include some restrictions on what the "
"definition is allowed to contain."
msgstr ""
"\ ``model``\ 定义是Modelica语言中最通用的定义方式。\ "
"稍后在本书中（或者在本章中）将会介绍其他的定义方式（例如：\ "
"``record``\ 定义）这些定义方式和\ ``model``\ 定义有着相同的语法结构，但在其包含的内容方面有所限制。\ "

"As we saw throughout this chapter, a model definition starts with the "
"``model`` keyword and is followed by a model name (and optionally a model "
"description).  The name of the model must start with a letter and can be "
"followed by any collection of letters, numbers or underscores (``_``)."

"正如我们在本章中看到的，模型定义首先是模型关键词。\ "
"其次是模型的名字（或者是模型的描述）。\ "

"Although not strictly required by the language.  It is a convention that "

"the so-called \"camel case\" convention where the first letter of each word "
"in the model name is upper case."

"尽管Modelica语言并没有对此进行严格要求，但一般约定模型名字以大写字母开头。\ "

"The model definition can contain variables and equations (to be discussed "
