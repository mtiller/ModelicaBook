"As we already touched on during our previous discussion on :ref:`steady-"
"state`, behavior is represented by both the equations contained in a model "
"as well as the initial conditions given to the state variables in the model."
"  In Modelica, the initial conditions are computed by combining the normal "
"equations (present in `equation` sections) with any initial equations "
"(present in `initial equation` sections)."
msgstr ""
"正如我们先前在 :ref:`steady-state` "
"这节中提到过的，初始化是由一个模型中的两个方程和模型中初始条件给定的状态变量来描述的。在Modelica中，初始条件是通过结合普通方程（在 "

"One of the first sources of confusion for new users is understanding how "
"many initial conditions are required.  The answer to this question is "
"simple.  In order to have a well-posed initialization problem (one where we "
"don't have too many or too few initial equations), we need to have the same "
"number of equations in the `initial equation` sections as we have states in "
"our system.  **Note**, we can get away with having too few, because tools "
"can augment the initial equations we provide with additional ones until the "
"problem is well-posed, but we cannot solve a problem where we have too many "
"initial equations."
msgstr ""
"对于初学者来说第一个混淆的来源是理解需要多少初始条件。这个问题的答案是简单的。为了有一个适定的初始化问题（就是没有过多或者过少的初始方程），需要如之前在系统中提到的在"
" `initial equation` (初始方程)中具有相同数量的方程。 **注意** "
",应当避免有太少的初始方程，因为工具可以增加我们给定的初始方程的数量直到问题适定，但是如果初始方程太多那问题就不能求解。"

"Of course, saying the number of initial equations has to be equal to the "
"number of states answers one question, but quickly creates another, *i.e.,* "
"*how do we determine how many states there are*?  For the models we've seen "
"in this chapter, the answer is quite simple.  The states in each of our "
"examples so far are the variables that appear inside the ``der(...)`` "
"operator.  In other words, every variable that we differentiated in those "
"examples is a state."

"It is important to note that **it will not always be the case** that every "

" dealing with ODEs, every differentiated variable is a state, which, in "

"  In those cases, only *some* of the differentiated variables can be "

"As it turns out, understanding initialization doesn't really require us to "
"get into a detailed discussion about DAEs.  In practice, all Modelica tools "
"perform something called \"index reduction\".  While the index reduction "
"algorithms themselves are fairly complicated (so we won't get into those "

"ODEs.  In other words, Modelica compilers will transform whatever DAE "

"事实上理解初始化不需要详细讨论DAEs。实际上，所有的Modelica工具都要执行所谓的 \"index reduction\" "
