"So far, all the examples we've seen have been of a purely continuous nature."
"  This means that there have been no abrupt disturbances in the system.  In "
"this chapter, we'll focus on how to express what we call \"discrete "
"behavior\".  There are a wide variety of different engineering use cases for"
" describing such behavior and we'll explore these through the various "
"examples presented in this chapter."
msgstr ""
"到目前为止，我们看到的例子均为纯粹连续的。"
"这意味着，系统中不曾受到没有突然的扰动。"
"本章中，我们将重点放在如何描述所谓“离散行为”上。"
"许多不同的工程用例描述类似的行为。"
"我们将在本章中通过不同的例子对其进行探索。"

"Normally, when we talk about discrete behavior we often refer to \"events\"."
"  An event is something that occurs in our system that triggers some kind of"
" discontinuity.  Differential equations normally result in continuous "
"solutions.  But when events occur, they can introduce various kinds of "
"discontinuities."
msgstr ""
"一般情况下，当谈论离散行为时，我们通常会提到“事件”（event） 。"
"事件是指，任何在系统内触发了某种不连续性的东西。"
"微分方程通常会有连续的解。"
"当产生事件的时候，他们会带来不同种类的不连续性。"

"The simplest types of events are ones that happen at a particular time.  "
"These are, not surprisingly, called \"time events\".  Because these events "
"are tied to time, we know what time they will occur even before they happen."
"  Examples of time events would be things like changes triggered by some "
"kind of digital clock that is activated at some specified frequency."
msgstr ""
"发生在某个特定时间的事件是最简单的一类事件。"
"这种事件自然被称作“时间事件”（time event）。由于这种事件和时间紧密相关，"
"我们甚至可以在时间发生前就知道发生时间。"
"以给定频率被激活的数字时钟所触发的变化就是时间事件的一个例子。"

msgid ""
"The other type of event we will encounter are so-called \"state events\".  "
"These kinds of events are much trickier to handle.  The reason is that we do"
" not know *a priori* when these events will occur.  Unlike time events, we "
"have to actually wait for some signal in our system to cross some specified "
"threshold.  Generally speaking, we don't know when that crossing will occur."
"  Furthermore, determining the precise moment when the event occurs is "
"somewhat expensive."
msgstr ""
"我们会遇到的另一类时间就是所谓的“状态事件”（state event）。"
"这类事件都通常更难以处理，原因是我们无法"
"\ *先验*\ 地知道发生此类事件的时间。和时间事件不同，我们必须"
"等到某信号越过特定阈值。"
"一般而言，我们不知道什么时候信号会越界。"
"此外，确定事件发生的精确时刻是比较昂贵的。"

"In this chapter, we'll look at examples of both of these kinds of events and"
" the various Modelica language features that can be used to describe when "
"these events occur and how we describe responses to them."
msgstr ""
"在本章中，我们将看到一系列有关这两类事件以及Modelica中处理事件的语言特性的例子。"
"这些语言特性可用于表述事件的产生条件以及对其的响应。"
