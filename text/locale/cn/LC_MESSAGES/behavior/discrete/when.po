"By using ``when``, we can express conditions we are interested in reacting "
"to and what we wish to do in response to them.  In this section, we'll "
"review the key ideas behind ``when`` statements.  A ``when`` statement has "
"the following general form:"

"In our discussion on :ref:`hysteresis`, we briefly discussed the difference "
"between an ``if`` statement and a ``when`` statement.  The statements in a "
"``when`` statement become active only for an instant when the triggering "
"conditional expression becomes true.  At all other times, the ``when`` "
"statement has no effect.  An ``if`` statement or ``if`` expression remains "
"active as long as the conditional expression is true.  If the ``if`` "
"statement or ``if`` expression includes an ``else`` clause then some branch "
"will always be active."

"Most of the time, the expression ``expr`` is going to be a conditional "
"expression and usually it will involve relational operators.  Typical "
"examples of expressions frequently used with a ``when`` statement would be "
"``time>=2.0``, ``x>=y+2``, ``phi<=prev_phi`` and so on. Recall from our "
"discussion of the :ref:`interval-measurement` speed estimation algorithm "
"that you should **almost always** put the ``pre`` operator around any "
"variables in ``expr`` that also appear inside the ``when`` statement."

"In the :ref:`bouncing-ball` example, we saw a case where ``expr`` was not a "
"(scalar) conditional expression, but rather a vector of conditional "
"expressions.  Recall from that discussion that the ``when`` statement "
"becomes active if **any** of the conditions in the vector of expressions "
"becomes true."

"A ``when`` statement is used to define new values for some variables. These "
"new values can be assigned in one of two ways.  The first is by introducing "
"an equation of the form:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/when.rst:62

"In this case, the variable ``var`` will be given the value of ``expr``.  "
"Within ``expr``, the ``pre`` operator should be used when referring to the "
"pre-event value for a variable.  Any variable assigned in this way is a "
"discrete variable.  This means that its value only changes during events.  "
"In other words, it will be a piecewise constant function.  Note, a variable "
"assigned in this way cannot be continuous over any interval in the "
"simulation."

"If you want to explicitly mark a variable as discrete, you can prefix it "
"with the ``discrete`` qualifier (as we saw in the :ref:`sample-and-hold` "
"example earlier in this chapter) although this is not strictly necessary.  "
"By adding the ``discrete`` qualifier you ensure that the variable's value "
"must be determined within a ``when`` statement."

"The other way a variable can be given a value within a ``when`` statement, "
"as demonstrated in the :ref:`bouncing-ball` example, is by using the "
"``reinit`` operator.  In that case, the statement within the ``when`` "
"statement will take the form:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/discrete/when.rst:88
msgid ""
"When using the ``reinit`` operator, the variable, ``var``, **must be a "
"state**.  In other words, its solution must arise from solving a "
"differential equation.  The use of ``reinit`` on such a variable has the "
"effect of stopping the integration process, changing the value of the state "
"(and any other states that have the ``reinit`` operator applied to them "
"within the same ``when`` statement) and then resuming integration using what"
" are effectively a new set of initial conditions.  The values of all other "
"states not re-initialized with the ``reinit`` operator remain unchanged."

"One final note about ``when`` statements is how they interact with the "
"\"single assignment\" rule in Modelica.  This rule, from the specification, "
"states that there must be exactly one equation used to determine the value "
"of each variable.  As we saw in the sections on :ref:`speed-measurement` and"
" :ref:`hysteresis`, it is sometimes necessary (or least clearer) to express "
"behavior in terms of multiple assignments.  In those cases, if all the "
"assignments are included within a single ``algorithm`` section, they are "
"effectively combined into a single equation.  However, doing so will limit "
"the compiler's ability to perform symbolic manipulation and, therefore, may "
"impact simulation performance and/or reusability of the models."

"It is also worth noting that if the semantics of an ``algorithm`` section "
"are needed during initialization, Modelica includes an ``initial algorithm``"
" section that is analogous to the ``initial equation`` section discussed in "
"the previous discussion on :ref:`initialization`.  The ``initial algorithm``"
" section will be applied only during the initialization phase to determine "
"initial conditions, just like an ``initial equation`` section, but the "
"``initial algorithm`` section will allow multiple assignments to the same "
"variable.  The same caveats apply with respect to symbolic manipulation."
