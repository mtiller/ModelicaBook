"Although it is pretty intuitive, it is worth having a short review of the "
"syntax for ``if`` statements and ``if`` expressions.  Let's start with "
"``if`` expressions because they are the simplest to explain.  An ``if`` "
"expression has the form:"

"where ``cexpr`` is a conditional expression (that will evaluate to a "
"``Boolean`` value), ``expr1`` is the value the expression will have if "
"``cexpr`` evaluates to ``true`` and ``expr2`` is the value the expression "
"will have if ``cexpr`` evaluates to ``false``."

"It is important to note that when an ``if`` statement appears in an "
"``equation`` section, the number of equations must be the same regardless of"
" which branch through the ``if`` statement is taken (this applies in the "
"presence of ``elseif`` as well).  One exception is the use of ``if`` within "
"an ``initial equation`` or ``initial algorithm`` section where an ``else`` "
"clause is not required since the number of equations doesn't have to be same"
" for both branches.  Another notable exception is the use of ``if`` within "
":ref:`functions` where, again, there is not requirement that the number of "
"equations be the same across both branches."
