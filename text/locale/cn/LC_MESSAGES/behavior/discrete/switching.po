"In this section, we'll present another model, like the heat transfer model "
"presented :ref:`earlier in this chapter <cooling-revisited>`, that contains "
"time events.  In this case, we'll show how we can simulate the behavior of a"
" switch in the context of an RLC circuit like :ref:`the one presented in the"
" first chapter <elec-example>`. From the examples presented so far, nothing "
"in this model should come as a surprise.  The main motivation for this "
"example is simply to present time events in the context of an electrical "
"model."

"在本节中，我们将介绍另一个模型。\ "
"正如\ :ref:`\ 本章前面部分\ "
"<cooling-revisited>`\ 介绍的传热模型一样，这个模型里包含时间事件。\ "
"这次，我们将展示如何能够模拟\ :ref:`\ 在第一章中介绍的那个\ <elec-example>`\ "
"RLC电路的开关行为。\ "
"在介绍了前面的例子后，这个模型应该不会让大家感到意外。\ "
"介绍这个例子仅仅是为了在电气模型背景下介绍时间事件。\ "

"The time event in this model is introduced via an ``if`` expression. The "
"fact that the only time-varying variable in the conditional expression is "
"``time`` means that this will trigger a time event and that the underlying "
"numerical solver will be able to determine *a priori* when the event will "
"occur while integrating the underlying equations."
msgstr ""
"时间事件在这个模型里是通过\ ``if``\ 表达式引入的。\ "
"条件表达式里唯一随着时间变化的量就是\ ``time``\ 。\ "
"这意味着条件表达式会触发"
"时间事件。\ "
"而当底层的数值求解器在对系统公式进行积分时，它可以\ *先验*\ 地知道"
"事件的发生时间。\ "
