"Let us consider the heat balance for each discrete section of this rod.  "

"where :math:`m` is the mass of the :math:`i^{th}` section, :math:`C` is the "

"That covers the thermal capacitance.  In addition, we will consider two "

"where :math:`h` is the convection coefficient.  The other form of heat "

"We start by defining types for the various physical quantities.  This will "

"We will also define several parameters to describe the rod we are "

"Finally, the only array in this problem is the temperature of each section "

"This concludes all the declarations we need to make.  Now let's consider the"
" various equations required.  First, we need to specify the initial "
"conditions for the rod.  We will assume that :math:`T_1(0)=200`, "
":math:`T_n(0)=300` and the initial temperatures of all other sections can be"
" linearly interpolated between these two end conditions.  This is captured "
"by the following equation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:175
msgid ""
"where the ``linspace`` operator is used to create an array of ``n`` values "
"that vary linearly between ``200`` and ``300``.  Recall from our :ref"
":`state-space` examples that we can include equations where the left hand "
"side and right hand side expressions are vectors.  This is another example "
"of such an equation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:181
msgid ""
"Finally, we come to the equations that describe how the temperature in each "
"section changes over time:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:188
msgid ""
"The first equation corresponds to the heat balance for section :math:`1`, "
"the last equation corresponds to the heat balance for section :math:`n` and "
"the middle equation covers all other sections. Note the use of ``end`` as a "
"subscript.  When an expression is used to evaluate a subscript for a given "
"dimension, ``end`` represents the size of that dimension.  In our case, we "
"use ``end`` to represent the last section.  Of course, we could use ``n`` in"
" this case, but in general, ``end`` can be very useful when the size of a "
"dimension is not already associated with a variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:198
msgid ""
"Also note the use of a ``for`` loop in this model.  A ``for`` loop allows "
"the loop index variable to loop over a range of values.  In our case, the "
"loop index variable is ``i`` and the range of values is :math:`2` through "
":math:`n-1`.  The general syntax for a ``for`` loop is:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:210
msgid ""
"where ``<range>`` is a vector of values.  A convenient way to generate a "
"sequence of values is to use the range operator, ``:``.  The value before "
"the range operator is the initial value in the sequence and the value after "
"the range operator is the final value in the sequence. So, for example, the "
"expression ``5:10`` would generate a vector with the values ``5``, ``6``, "
"``7``, ``8``, ``9`` and ``10``.  Note that this **includes** the values used"
" to specify the range."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:218
msgid ""
"When a ``for`` loop is used in an equation section, each iteration of the "
"for loop generates a new equation for each equation inside the ``for`` loop."
"  So in our case, we will generate :math:`n-2` equations corresponding to "
"values of ``i`` between ``2`` and ``n-1``."

"It turns out that there are several ways we can generate the equations we "
"need.  Each has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the "
"context.  We'll present them here just to demonstrate the possibilities.  "
"The choice of which one they feel leads to the most understandable equations"
" is up to the model developer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:255
msgid ""
"One array feature we can use to make these equations slightly simpler is "
"called an array comprehension.  An array comprehension flips the ``for`` "
"loop around so that we take a single equation and add some information at "
"the end indicating that the equation should be evaluated for different "
"values of the loop index variable.  In our case, we can represent our "
"equation section using array comprehensions as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:267
msgid ""
"We could also combine the array comprehension with some ``if`` expressions "
"to nullify contributions to the heat balance that don't necessarily apply.  "
"In that case, we can simplify the ``equation`` section to the point where it"
" contains one (admittedly multi-line) equation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:277
msgid ""
"Recall, from several previous examples, that Modelica supports vector "
"equations.  In these cases, when the left hand and right hand side are "
"vectors of the same size, we can use a single (vector) equation to represent"
" many scalar equations.  We can use this feature to simplify our equations "
"as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:287
msgid ""
"Note that when a vector variable like ``T`` has a range of subscripts "
"applied to it, the result is a vector containing the components indicated by"
" the values in the subscript.  For example, the expression ``T[2:4]`` is "
"equivalent to ``{T[2], T[3], T[4}``.  The subscript expression doesn't need "
"to be a range.  For example, ``T[{2,5,9}]`` is equivalent to ``{T[2], T[5], "
"T[9]}``."

msgid ""
"Finally, let us consider one last way of refactoring these equations. "
"Imagine we introduced two additional vector variables:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:301
msgid ""
"Then we can write these two equations (again using vector equations) to "
"define the heat lost to the previous and next section in the rod:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/arrays/oned.rst:308
