"If, for some reason, you are coming upon this book without any previous "
"knowledge of Modelica, there are probably a couple of questions you have.  "
"Let me attempt to address these questions in the hope that they will "
"intrigue you and cause you to dig deeper."
msgstr ""
"你可能出于某些原因，机缘巧合看到本书。\ "
"若你没有任何Modelica方面的知识，对于Modelica语言你可能会有一些疑惑。\ "
"我尝试列出这些问题，希望可以引起你的兴趣并引导你深入地探索。\ "

msgid ""
"Modelica is a high-level declarative language for describing mathematical "
"behavior.  It is typically applied to engineering systems and can be used to"
" easily describe the behavior of different types of engineering components "
"(*e.g.,* springs, resistors, clutches, *etc.*).  These components can then "
"be combined into subsystems, systems or even architectures."
msgstr ""
"Modelica是一种高级的陈述式语言用于描述事物的数学特性。\ "
"它通常应用于工程领域，\ "
"可以轻松的描述不同类型工程组件（例如弹簧、电阻、离合器等）的工作特性。\ "
"此外，这些组件又可以方便的组合成子系统、系统，甚至架构模型。\ "

"Modelica is compelling for several reasons.  First and foremost, it is "
"technically very capable.  By using complex algorithms behind the scenes, "
"Modelica compilers allow engineers to focus on high-level mathematical "
"descriptions of component behavior and get high performance simulation "
"capability in return without having to be deeply knowledgeable about complex"
" topics like differential-algebraic equations, symbolic manipulation, "
"numeric solvers, code generation, post-processing, *etc.*."
msgstr ""
"Modelica语言令人信服的原因主要有以下几点。\ "
"第一，也是最重要的是它的技术实力。\ "
"Modelica编译器在后台运行复杂的算法，\ "
"使得工程师可以将工作重点放在组件特性的数学描述上，以获得高性能的仿真速度。\ "
"而工程师不需要具备某些相关领域的高深知识，\ "
"例如微分代数方程组、符号运算、数值求解、代码生成、后处理等。\ "

"The key to Modelica's technical success is its support for a wide range of "
"modeling formalisms that allow the description of both continuous and "
"discrete behavior framed in the context of hybrid differential-algebraic "
"equations.  The language supports both causal (often used for control system"
" design) and acausal (often used in creating schematic oriented physical "
"designs) approaches *within the same model*."
msgstr ""
"Modelica语言在技术实现上能成功的关键是它支持广泛的建模形式，即Modelica语言支持在混合微分代数方程组中"
"同时描述连续和离散特性。\ "
"Modelica语言支持\ *在同一模型中*\ 同时使用因果（通常用于控制系统"
"设计）和非因果（通常用于创建面向原理的物理模型设计）的建模方法。\ "

"Finally, another compelling aspect of Modelica is the fact that it was "
"designed from the start as an open language.  The specification is freely "
"available and tool vendors are encouraged to support the import and export "
"of Modelica (without being compelled to pay any royalty of any kind)."
msgstr ""
"最后，Modelica语言另一个引人注目的事实是：\ "
"Modelica从一开始就是作为开放的语言标准设计的。\ "
"Modelica语言规范可以免费获得。\ "
"这大大激励了工具供应商支持Modelica模型导入、导出的热情（因为不需要强制支付任何形式的版税）。\ "

"Modelica is really an ideal language for modeling the behavior of "
"engineering systems in nearly any engineering domain.  It seamlessly "
"supports both physical design and control design in a single language. It is"
" also multi-domain so it doesn't impose any artificial boundaries that "
"restrict its use to select engineering domains or systems.  The result is "
"that it provides a complete set of capabilities for building lumped system "
"models of nearly any engineering system."
msgstr ""
"Modelica绝对是一种理想的建模语言，它几乎可以用于所有工程领域的系统特性建模。\ "
"单纯使用Modelica语言，就可以完美的支持物理模型设计和控制模型设计。\ "
"同时，Modelica语言也具有多领域性，\ "
"因此它不会强制引入任何人为的干涉来限制其应用的工程领域或系统。\ "
"综上所述，Modelica语言提供了一整套用于建立集总参数模型的方法，几乎涉及所有的工程应用系统。\ "
