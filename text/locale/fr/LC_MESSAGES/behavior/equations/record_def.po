"Earlier, we introduced the idea of a ``model`` definition.  Although we "
"haven't seen any yet, Modelica also includes a ``record`` type.  A "
"``record`` can have variables, just like a ``model``, but it is not allowed "
"to include equations.  Records are primarily used to group data together.  "
"But as we will see shortly, they are also very useful in describing the data"
" associated with :ref:`annotations`."

"As with a ``model``, the definition starts and ends with the name of the "
"record being defined.  An explanation of the ``record`` can be included as a"
" string after the name.  All the variables associated with the record are "
"declared within the ``record`` definition."

"Now that we know how to define a ``record``, we need to know how to create "
"one.  If we are declaring a variable that happens to be a ``record``, the "
"declaration itself will create an instance of the ``record`` and we can "
"specify the values of variables inside the record using modifications, "
"*e.g.*,"

"But there are some cases where we might want to create an instance of a "
"``record`` that isn't a variable (*e.g.*, to use in an expression, pass as "
"an argument to a function or use in a modification).  For each ``record`` "
"definition, a function is automatically generated with the **same name** as "
"the ``record``.  This function is called the \"record constructor\".  The "
"record constructor has input arguments that match the variables inside the "
"``record`` definition and returns an instance of that ``record``.  So in the"
" case of the ``Vector`` definition above, we could also initialize a "
"``parameter`` using the record constructor as follows:"

"In this case, the value for ``v`` comes from the **expression** "
"``Vector(x=1.0, y=2.0, z=0.0)`` which is a call to the record constructor."
