"Although the previous section got us started with representing mathematical "
"behavior, it doesn't convey any connection to *physical* behavior.  In this "
"section, we'll explore how to build models that represent the modeling of "
"physical behavior.  Along the way, we will highlight some of the language "
"features we can leverage that will not only tie these models to physical and"
" engineering domains, but, as we shall see, they can even help us avoid "
"mistakes."

msgid "Let's start with the following example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:22
msgid ""
"As we saw in the examples in our discussion of :ref:`first-order`, the "
"previous example consists of a ``model`` definition that includes variables "
"and equations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:26
msgid ""
"However, this time we see the word ``parameter`` for the first time. "
"Generally speaking, the ``parameter`` keyword is used to indicate variables "
"whose value is known *a priori* (*i.e.*, prior to the simulation).  More "
"precisely, ``parameter`` is a keyword that specifies the *variability* of a "
"variable.  This will be discussed more thoroughly in the section on "
":ref:`variability`.  But for now, we can think of a ``parameter`` as a "
"variable whose value we must provide."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:35
msgid ""
"Looking at our ``NewtonCooling`` example, we see there are five parameters: "
"``T_inf``, ``T0``, ``h``, ``A``, ``m`` and ``c_p``.  We don't need to bother"
" explaining what these variables are because the model itself includes a "
"descriptive string for each one.  At the moment, there are no values for "
"these parameters, but we will return to that topic shortly.  As with all the"
" variables we have seen so far, these are all of type ``Real``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:43
msgid ""
"Let's examine the rest of this model.  The next variable is ``T`` (also a "
"``Real``).  Since this variable doesn't have the ``parameter`` qualifier, "
"its value is determined by the equations in the model."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:47
msgid ""
"Next we see the two ``equation`` sections.  The first is an ``initial "
"equation`` section which specifies how the variable ``T`` should be "
"initialized.  It should be pretty clear that the initial value for ``T`` is "
"going to be whatever value was given (by us) for the parameter ``T0``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:53
msgid ""
"The other equation is the differential equation that governs the behavior of"
" ``T``.  Mathematically, we could express this equation as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:58
msgid "but in Modelica, we write it as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:67
msgid ""
"One thing worth noting is that the equation in our ``NewtonCooling`` example"
" contains an **expression** on the left hand side.  In Modelica, it is "
"**not** necessary for each equation to be an explicit equation for a single "
"variable.  An equation can contain arbitrary expressions on either side of "
"the equals sign.  It is the compiler's job to determine how to use these "
"equations to solve for the variables contained in the equations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:75
msgid ""
"Another thing that distinguishes our ``NewtonCooling`` example from the "
"``FirstOrder`` model is that we can independently adjust the different "
"parameter values.  Furthermore, these parameter values are tied to physical,"
" measurable properties of the materials or environmental conditions.  In "
"other words, this version is slightly more physical than the simple "
"mathematical relationship used in the ``FirstOrder`` model because it is "
"related to physical properties."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:83
msgid ""
"Now, we can't really run the ``NewtonCooling`` model as is because it lacks "
"*values* for the six parameters.  In order to create a model that is ready "
"to be simulated, we need to provide those values, *e.g.*,"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:92
msgid ""
"The only real difference here is that each of the ``parameter`` variables "
"now has a value specified.  One way to think about the ``NewtonCooling`` "
"model is that we could not simulate it because it had 7 variables (total) "
"and only one equation (see the section on :ref:`initialization` for an "
"explanation of why the ``initial equation`` doesn't really count).  However,"
" the ``NewtonCoolingWithDefaults`` model has, conceptually speaking, 7 "
"equations (6 of them coming from specifying the values of the ``parameter`` "
"variables + one in the equation section) and 7 unknowns."

"As mentioned already in this section, these examples are a bit more physical"
" because they include individual physical parameters that correspond to "
"individual properties of our real world system. However, we are still "
"missing something.  Although these variables represent physical quantities "
"like temperature, mass, *etc.*, we haven't explicitly given them any "
"physical types."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:120
msgid ""
"As you may have already guessed, the variable ``T`` is a temperature. This "
"is made clear in the descriptive text associated with the variable.  "
"Furthermore, it doesn't take a very deep analysis of our previous model to "
"determine that ``T0`` and ``T_inf`` must also be temperatures."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:126
msgid ""
"But what about the other variables like ``h`` or ``A``?  What do they "
"represent?  Even more important, are the equations **physically "
"consistent**?  By physically consistent, we mean that both sides of the "
"equations have the same physical units (*e.g.*, temperature, mass, power)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:132
msgid ""
"We could convey the physical units of the different variables more "
"rigorously by actually including them in the variable declarations, like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:142
msgid ""
"Note that each of the variable declarations now includes the text "
"``(unit=\"...\")`` to associate a physical unit with the variable.  What "
"this additional text does is specify a value for the ``unit`` attribute "
"associated with the variable.  Attributes are special properties that each "
"variable has.  The set of attributes a variable can have depends on the type"
" of the variable (this is discussed in more detail in the upcoming section "
"on :ref:`variables`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:150
msgid ""
"At first glance, it may not seem obvious why specifying the unit attribute "
"(*e.g.*, ``(unit=\"K\")``) is any better than simply adding "
"``\"Temperature\"`` to the descriptive string following the variable. In "
"fact, one might even argue it is worse because \"Temperature\" is more "
"descriptive than just a single letter like \"K\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:156
msgid ""
"However, setting the ``unit`` attribute is actually a more formal approach "
"for two reasons.  The first reason is that the Modelica specification "
"defines relationships for all the standard SI unit attributes (*e.g.*, "
"``K``, ``kg``, ``m``).  This includes complex unit types that can be "
"composed of other base units (*e.g.*, ``N``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:162
msgid ""
"The other reason is that the Modelica specification also defines rules for "
"how to compute the units of complex mathematical expressions.  In this way, "
"the Modelica specification defines everything that is necessary to **unit "
"check** Modelica models for errors or physical inconsistencies.  This is a "
"big win for model developers because adding units not only makes the models "
"clearer, it provides better diagnostics in the case of errors."

"But truth be told, there is one drawback of the code for our "
"``NewtonCoolingWithUnits`` example and that is that we have to repeat the "
"``unit`` attribute specification for every variable.  Furthermore, as "
"mentioned previously, ``K`` isn't nearly as descriptive as \"Temperature\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:183
msgid ""
"Fortunately, we have a simple solution to both problems because Modelica "
"allows us to define *derived types*.  So far, all the variables we have "
"declared have been of type ``Real``.  The problem with ``Real`` is that it "
"could be anything (*e.g.*, a voltage, a current, a temperature).  What we'd "
"like to do is narrow things down a bit.  This is where derived types come "
"in.  To see how to define derived types and then use them in declarations, "
"consider the following example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:199
msgid ""
"You can read the definition ``type Temperature=Real(unit=\"K\", min=0);`` as"
" \"Let us define a new type, ``Temperature``, that is a specialization of "
"the built-in type ``Real`` with physical units of Kelvin (``K``) and a "
"minimum possible value of ``0``\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:204
msgid ""
"From this example, we can see that once we define a physical type like "
"``Temperature``, we can use it to declare multiple variables (*e.g.*, ``T``,"
" ``T_inf`` and ``T0``) without having to specify the ``unit`` or ``min`` "
"attribute for each variable.  Also, we get to use the familiar name "
"``Temperature`` instead of the SI unit, ``K``.  You might be wondering what "
"other attributes are available when creating derived types.  For further "
"discussion, see the section on :ref:`builtin-types`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/behavior/equations/physical.rst:213
msgid ""
"At this point, you might find the idea of defining ``Temperature``, "
"``ConvectionCoefficient``, ``SpecificHeat`` and ``Mass`` in every model "
"extremely tedious.  It would be, if it were truly necessary. But don't "
"worry, there is an easy solution to this as you will see in a later section "
"where we discuss :ref:`importing_physical_types`."
